Each group addressed one of two types of narrow reading: same genre and same title. The same genre texts were three graded readers in the Sherlock Holmes series, and the same title texts were The Railway Children, published by three different publishers at different language levels. The study was conducted over a 3-week period. Then, two approximately 1,000-word texts, one related to Sherlock Holmes and one to The Railway Children, were used to measure whether the participants’ reading speed and comprehension differed in reading the two types of texts. The results showed that all participants read significantly faster and comprehended more with the related text than the unrelated text. A questionnaire on participants’ perceptions showed positive responses to narrow reading, especially the same title treatment. Pedagogical implications are discussed. Keywords: narrow reading, reading speed, reading fluency, reading comprehension This study explored an under-researched area—narrow reading—on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ reading fluency and perceptions. Although narrow reading is not a newly coined term (see Krashen, 1981), very little research has been done on it. Narrow reading refers to readers focusing on the work of a single author or a single topic over the course of a number of texts for an extended period of time (Krashen, 1996; McQuillan, 2016; Schmitt & Carter, 2000). It can also be considered another approach to (or a subset of) extensive reading (wide reading), but the two differ in how texts are selected or organized. The texts in narrow reading are related to each other, which means that learners do not have to switch from one topic to another or call on completely new background knowledge to comprehend different texts. This may allow learners to process the input more smoothly. Related texts also contain fewer word types because key words and proper nouns are more likely to recur across texts, which may ease the lexical burden (Gardner, 2008; Schmitt & Carter, 2000). Given the advantages of narrow Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 2 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) reading—more familiar background knowledge and less lexical burden—it is likely that readers can efficiently improve their reading fluency, i.e., reading rate (speed) and comprehension. These two components are associated with each other, and reading fluency is defined as “decoding and comprehension at the same time” (Samuels, 2006, p. 9). Decoding refers to readers having to rapidly process the lower-level components, such as orthographic, phonological, syntactic and semantic information, and then drawing on background knowledge and making inferences. While reading fluently, readers must process all these components automatically, which may be difficult for second language (L2) learners, in particular for lowerlevel processing (Grabe, 2009). Automaticity theorists suggest making some components more automatic, which may allow readers to pay more attention to the tasks that need more controlled attention. Given this, narrow reading seems to provide optimal conditions for developing fluency. Even if readers can automatically decode the linguistic elements and make inferences, their reading rates may not be constant. According to Carver (1992), reading rates are so changeable that it may be impossible to predict what a given student’s reading rate will be under a given set of conditions. A number of factors may affect reading rates and the level of reading comprehension. Some of these are reading purpose, text difficulty, vocabulary load, the amount of reading experience, and background knowledge. Carver (1990) proposed five gears of reading for first language (L1) adult readers: scanning, skimming, rauding, reading to learn, and reading to memorize; each gear having a different rate and involving different levels of cognitive processes. The highest gear is scanning, the fastest reading process; its goal may be just to identify a target word in a text. The second highest gear is skimming; its purpose is to find specific information or simply to comprehend the gist of a text. The third gear, rauding, refers to a combination of reading and auding (listening); its goal is general comprehension. The typical rauding rate is approximately 300 words per minute (wpm) for college students, and this rate may represent an individual’s natural or optimum reading speed. This gear involves processing the low and high level components of fluent reading. The second lowest gear is reading to learn. It is usually used by students to learn information from textbooks. This gear operates at 200 wpm and requires some effort to synthesize what is read. The lowest reading gear is reading to memorize. It requires readers to be able to recall information accurately. It is believed to occur at 138 wpm for college students. However, these proposed reading rates are for educated L1 readers. For L2 readers, the rates have been found to be much slower (See Chang & Millett, 2015). Apart from reading purpose, an individual’s reading experience may, to some degree, affect reading rates and comprehension levels. It is generally agreed that a more experienced reader has better decoding skills, so their reading rate is faster. Another factor is the difficulty of the text. If the text’s relative difficulty exceeds one’s reading abilities, both reading rates and comprehension levels will decline. Text difficulty may arise from an individual’s lack of vocabulary knowledge or topical knowledge of the field, and it is the most common issue for most L2 readers. Hence, this study will particularly look into these two factors, which will be reviewed below. Narrow reading may provide some optimal conditions, such as better background knowledge and repetition of key lexical items. However, the practice of using narrow reading to facilitate learning is still an under-researched area. To my knowledge, there has been no research Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 3 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) investigating the effect of narrow reading on developing reading fluency. However, there are some studies looking into learning vocabulary through narrow reading, and reviewing some of the relevant studies may assist our understanding of the role that vocabulary plays in narrow reading. The Role of Vocabulary in Narrow Reading Some corpus-driven studies have shown that narrowly reading a series of related texts recycles vocabulary more effectively than randomly reading unrelated texts (Hwang & Nation, 1989; Rodgers & Webb, 2011; Schmitt & Carter, 2000; Sutarsyah, Nation, & Kennedy, 1994). For example, both Hwang and Nation (1989), and Schmitt and Carter (2000) compared related and unrelated newspaper stories and found that the density of new word families decreased significantly in the related stories but less so in the unrelated stories. This finding suggested that vocabulary load was reduced to a greater extent in reading related stories. Schmitt and Carter posited that reading related stories lowers the lexical load for L2 learners, and thus might allow learners earlier contact with authentic reading materials. Similar results are found in reading academic texts versus random texts (Sutarsyah et al., 1994), and viewing related versus unrelated television episodes (Rodgers & Webb, 2011). These corpus-driven studies provide consistent evidence that texts on the same or related topics are more likely to have more recurrences of specialized words than unrelated texts. Empirical studies also provide support for corpus-driven research (Cho, Ahn, & Krashen, 2005; Cho & Krashen, 1994; Kang, 2015). For example, Cho and Krashen (1994) asked four L2 adults to read the Sweet Valley series for pleasure in their free time, and then assessed their vocabulary acquisition rates in individual tests. The average vocabulary learning rate reported was 62%. Positive results were also reported in a later study with young L2 Korean elementary school pupils (Cho, Ahn, & Krashen, 2005) who were asked to read the Clifford book series. Recently, a more rigorous study was conducted by Kang (2015) with senior high school students who read four online texts, either thematically related articles on second-hand smoking or unrelated articles, over one month. The students were tested on their gains of receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge. The results showed that narrow reading led to better gains than random reading in both receptive and productive knowledge. The Role of Background Knowledge in Narrow Reading As previously mentioned, reading comprehension takes place when readers draw on what is decoded and then relate this to their background knowledge, which can be general knowledge, cultural knowledge or knowledge of a certain topic or discipline. A number of studies have shown that familiarity with the background knowledge of a text enhances comprehension (see Hudson, 1982; Pulido, 2004, 2007; Taglieber, Johnson, & Yarbrough, 1988). One efficient way to gain specific background knowledge or contextual knowledge is narrow reading. According to Lamme (1976), good L1 English readers tend to read books from the same series or books written by a single author or books on a single topic. In their series study, Cho and Krashen (1994, 1995a, 1995b) reported that their EFL learners, who had never experienced the pleasure Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 4 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) of reading in English, became Sweet Valley fans. In just one year, they read Sweet Valley Kids, Sweet Valley Twins and then Sweet Valley High. After reading the whole series, one learner read an additional four Harlequin Romance novels, and eight novels by Danielle Steel and Sydney Sheldon. The above studies suggest that reading a series of related texts may enhance readers’ background knowledge, which further motivates them to read more and eventually become a good reader. Improving Reading Rates in L2 Learning Despite all of these convincing findings on acquiring vocabulary through narrow reading, there are no studies that look at whether L2 students can comprehend better and read faster through reading related texts rather than unrelated ones. There are, however, several approaches that have been recommended by second language scholars to improve L2 learners’ reading fluency. For example, repeated reading—rereading the same texts several times until a satisfactory rate is achieved (Dowhower, 1987; Gorsuch & Taguchi, 2008, 2010; Gorsuch, Taguchi & Umehara, 2015; Taguchi, Takayasu-Maass, & Gorsuch, 2004); timed reading—measuring the time spent on reading a text (see a recent work by Chang, 2012; Chang & Millett, 2013); self-paced reading, or class-paced reading (see Anderson, 1999, for details), or extensive reading (see Chang & Millett, 2015 for a recent comprehensive review). Because, narrow reading is a subset of extensive reading, the two differing only in the selection of texts, it is useful to briefly review how extensive reading improves reading rates. A few studies look at how L2 students improved their reading rates through extensive reading (Beglar, Hunt, & Kite, 2012; Chang & Millett, 2015; Iwahori, 2008; Taguchi et al., 2004). With the exception of Chang and Millett (2015), most of these studies followed an important principle of extensive reading —readers choose their own materials (Day, 2015). However, it is not clear how students chose their books. None of these studies reported that students focused on a certain genre or a specific author. For example, Iwahori (2008) required 33 junior high students to read 28 books over a 7-week period, and the students improved approximately 29 wpm, from 84 to 113 wpm. However, reading comprehension was not measured. On the other hand, Yamashita (2008) asked 47 university students to read 11 graded readers over a 15-week period, and found a significant improvement on students’ comprehension, but reading rate was not assessed. Whether reading rate and comprehension improve at the same time is unclear in these two studies. Other studies assessed improvements in both reading rates and comprehension. For example, Bell (2001) asked 14 Yemeni adults to read extensively for two semesters, and he found that they improved 60 wpm, which was much more than the intensive reading group, which increased only 15 wpm. Beglar et al. (2012) investigated the effects of one year of reading for pleasure on the reading rate development of 97 Japanese freshmen. The results showed that the three reading for pleasure groups improved 8.02, 12.84, and 16.85 standard wpm respectively, while the intensive reading group improved only 2.97 standard wpm. Despite the increasing rates, comprehension was not sacrificed; the students remained at a high level of comprehension. Asking students to read and then answer comprehension questions, however, may have changed the purpose of reading, and it could have slowed down the students’ reading rates. Therefore, their results may Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 5 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) not entirely reflect rauding or normal reading speed. All the studies reviewed required students to read silently. More recently, another line of research has adopted simultaneous input of reading and listening, in which learners read and listened to the oral rendition of the text at the same time. Researchers assume that simultaneous reading and listening have the following advantages. First, reading and listening help learners to match the spoken form and written form. Second, the effect of sound makes the input more interesting and helps students to remain on task. Third, the speaker segments the texts for the learners, which help them to read faster and be weaned away from word-by-word reading. This form of input has been found to be beneficial to lower-level students (Chang & Millett, 2015; Taguchi et al., 2004). In the study by Chang and Millett (2015), 64 secondary school students read 20 graded readers during a 26-week period. One group adopted silent reading and the other simultaneous reading and listening. The results demonstrated that the simultaneous reading and listening group improved 43 wpm, whereas the silent group improved only 18 wpm. The comprehension levels were also much higher for the simultaneous reading and listening group. Given the results, more research on this form of input is warranted. Therefore, this study will adopt the technique of simultaneous reading and listening. Research Questions The previous studies using extensive reading to improve reading rates showed positive but slow improvement. This study investigated whether students who read a series of related texts, read faster and comprehend better than if they read unrelated texts. It also looked at how students perceived the type of input. Two groups of students were randomly assigned to read different texts. One group (termed genre-group) read different titles in the Sherlock Holmes series, and the other group (termed title-group) read one story—The Railway Children, published by three different publishers (Penguin, Compass, and Oxford) at different levels. After the treatment, all participants were given a related and an unrelated text to read, and their reading rates, comprehension levels, and perceptions were measured. This study did not attempt to look at students’ reading rate improvement within the 3-week period but investigated whether reading related texts helped students to read faster and comprehend better than reading unrelated texts. Three research questions were addressed: RQ1. Did the reading rates of the genre-group and title-group differ to a significant degree when they read familiar and unfamiliar passages? RQ2. To what degree did the reading comprehension levels of the genre-group and title-group differ when they read familiar and unfamiliar passages? RQ3. How did the genre-group and title-group perceive the input? Methods Participants This study involved fifty-three 18-year-old Taiwanese senior high school students who were Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 6 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) taking a required reading class of four 45-minute sessions per week. Administrators randomly divided the participants into two groups which were termed title-group and genre-group (terms to be explained shortly). The participants took a pretest based on a 400-word passage to determine their reading speed and comprehension level. The pretest was used to measure whether the two groups were comparable at the onset of the study, but was not used for comparing their progress (not the purpose of the study). The passage described how coffee beans were discovered and how coffee became a popular drink in Ethiopia. Both the text and the comprehension questions were written by the second author for developing her students’ reading speeds. The comprehension test contained 10 multiple-choice test items with four options in each question. The results showed that the title-group (T-group) read at an average of 122.95 wpm (SD = 16.01), and the genre-group (G-group) 127.94 wpm (SD = 30.86), indicating no statistically significant difference between the two groups, F (1, 51) = .53, p = .47. Similarly, the T-group scored 65.60 (SD = 8.21) and the G-group 65.32 (SD = 17.50) on the comprehension test, demonstrating comparable comprehension levels between the groups, F (1, 51) = .01, p = .94. Study materials Selecting appropriate texts for students to read was challenging. The process of deciding on The Railway Children for the T-group was particularly time consuming. The researchers first selected 15 classic titles, such as A Christmas Carol and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from five major publishers, Oxford Bookworms, Macmillan, Cambridge English, Penguin, and Compass. Because the text levels are not quite consistent across publishers, two student research assistants scanned all the selected texts and then analyzed them using the British National Corpus/Corpus of Contemporary American English ( BNC/COCA) (Nation, 2012). The first researcher, two students and one L2 teacher further read all the selected materials. Based on the vocabulary profile and the complexity of each story’s scenario, The Railway Children, published by Penguin, Compass, and Oxford Bookworms, was the best candidate to use for the T-Group (see below for the description). Determining the text for the G-group was much easier. The choice was based on the first author’s teaching experience in the area of extensive reading, in which many of her students enjoyed the Sherlock Holmes stories very much. The Oxford Bookworms series also publishes graded readers on Sherlock Holmes, ranging from Level 1 to Level 3. By scanning and analyzing all of the texts, as we had done in selecting The Railway Children, three graded readers on Sherlock Holmes were selected (see below for more details). The G-group: The study materials for the G-group were Sherlock Holmes and the Duke’s Son (Bassett, 2008), Sherlock Holmes Short Stories (West, 2000), and The Last Sherlock Holmes Story (Kerr, 2008). The titles have 6,101, 6,419, and 10,489 words respectively, and the total word count is 23,009. Other lexical information, such as the percentage (%) and the total words (token, in parentheses) of each word level in each text, is analyzed by BNC/COCA and presented in Table 1.

Each book has 5,016, 8,182, and 9,661 words respectively. The total word count is 22,850. Though the book published by Penguin is classified as Level 2, the vocabulary profile in Table 2 showed that it was easier than the Compass text. In addition, all the three graded readers had been previously read by the researchers and experienced ER students before determining the reading order: Penguin, Compass, and then Oxford. Overall, the characteristics of the three graded readers are as follows: The Penguin reader is the shortest in length, contains the fewest unknown words and the scenario is very easy to comprehend. The Compass reader scenario is similar to the Penguin one but has many more unknown words. Finally, the Oxford Bookworm reader contains many more story details. Table 2.

In The Railway Children books, 18 of the 30 words appear in one text, 8 of the 30 words in two texts (platform, porter, pram, fetch, whisper, maid, mend, and petticoat), and 4 of the 30 words in three texts (tunnel, wave, signal, and coal). It is apparent that there are many more words reoccurring across different texts in The Railway Children than in the Sherlock Holmes stories. Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 8 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) The dependent measures Two new passages were selected to measure students’ reading speeds and comprehension. One was the first two chapters of Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings graded reader. The other, The Railway Children, was downloaded from Project Gutenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org) and modified by the authors to make the lengths and difficulty of the two texts more comparable and also to fit the criterion of 95% coverage of the first 2,000 words plus proper nouns. As can be seen in Table 3, the length and vocabulary profiles of the two passages were similar, and the text coverage of the first 1,000 words was nearly the same, 87.18% and 87.67% and the token counts of the 1,000 word level were 932 and 903 respectively. It has to be noted that although Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings is rated Level 1, its vocabulary level is similar to texts the students had previously read (see Table 1). Reading rate: To measure students’ reading speeds, all students were given a practice test first. An online stopwatch was downloaded and projected onto a big screen for students to time their reading. To balance the test order, each group was split into two subgroups: half the students in each group read the familiar passage, and the other half read the unfamiliar one. All students read at the same time. When they finished reading, each student put up his or her hand, and test papers were given out and reading passages collected at the same time. This meant that they had no opportunities to look for information while they were answering the questions. Reading comprehension: To measure students’ reading comprehension on The Railway Children, the test questions included only the information that had not appeared in the books they read. Twenty-five questions were developed for each passage. The question types included multiplechoice items, short answer questions, yes/no, gap-fill, and true/false. The test questions were developed by the second author and revised by the first author after being piloted on four students from a different class, before being administered to the participants.

The first five items concerned the learners’ perceptions on overall reading ease, reading speed, confidence, comprehension, and the interest levels of the scenarios. The students had to select one description that best described their perception from a 7-point Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 9 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) scale (1: entirely disagree, 2: mostly disagree; 3: somewhat disagree, 4: not sure; 5: somewhat agree; 6: mostly agree; 7: entirely agree). Item 6 and Item 7 targeted their vocabulary learning. The students not only had to select one response to describe their feelings, but they also had to give some examples to support the response they selected. The last item was an open-ended question. The students could write down anything that they wanted to regarding the treatment. See Appendix A for the short questionnaire. Procedure The two groups of participants had no experience of reading independently in L2, nor had they read any graded readers. Before the formal experiment began, the two groups read and listened to three graded readers, one each from Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The purpose of this was to have the students gain some reading experience before the actual experiment started. After reading the three practice books, a pretest was given to determine the reading speeds of the two groups and to check unknown words (to explore the participants’ word knowledge of the materials that they would read). The G-group then started to read and listen to the three graded readers in the following order: Sherlock Holmes and the Duke’s Son (Level 1), Sherlock Holmes Short Stories (Level 2), and The Last Sherlock Holmes Story (Level 3); and the T-group read and listened to The Railway Children, in the publisher order of Penguin, Compass, and Oxford Bookworms. It took 3 weeks for the students to complete the three books. There were two reasons why it took three weeks to finish the books. Firstly, the students had had little prior experience of reading stories, so the first researcher had to stop every one or two chapters to ask the students questions to make sure that the students were comprehending the story scenarios. Secondly, the books were all read in class. The students who were late for class or were absent from class during the treatment period were still allowed to the take the tests on reading speed and comprehension, but their data were excluded from the study. The procedure is summarized in Table 4: Table 4: Summary of tasks finished in each timeline Week Tasks 1–5 This was the warm-up stage. All students read and listened to three graded readers in the following order: The Elephant Man, Grace Darling, and Chemical Secret 6 break 7–9 A pretest on reading speed was administered, and students’ knowledge of unknown words was checked. G-group read and listened to three Sherlock Holmes stories. T-group read and listened to three versions of The Railway Children, published by three different publishers. 10 Tests on reading speed and comprehension were administered and the questionnaire on the perceptions of narrow reading was completed Data analysis The data collected was analyzed with SPSS 23 for Windows. The reading speed was calculated by wmp using the following formula: [(total word counts/total time in seconds) x 60]. The reading comprehension was calculated in percentages (correct items x 4), making it easier for readers to understand. The reliabilities of the two reading tests were also calculated in Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 10 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) Cronbach’s alpha. To answer the first and second research questions, paired samples t tests were used to compare the differences within groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparing the differences between groups. The dependent variables were reading speed (wpm) and reading comprehension (in percentage). The independent variable was the reading condition (title and genre). In addition to comparing the p values, the effect sizes in eta squared and Cohen’s d were also calculated to examine whether the p values have any practical importance. Multiple t tests using a Bonferroni correction were used to compare the differences between groups’ perceptions for the third research questions. Results Reading rates To answer the first research question regarding the rates for reading familiar and unfamiliar texts, the differences within each group were first compared and then comparisons were made between groups. For the within group, the T-group read The Railway Children at an average speed of 142 wpm and at 126 wpm for Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings. A significant difference in speed was found for the T-group reading familiar or unfamiliar texts, t (24) = 3.5, p = .002. The effect size calculated by eta squared was very large (η 2 = .34)1 . The G-group read The Railway Children at a speed of 128 wpm, and 146 wpm for Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings. The difference in reading speed for reading familiar versus unfamiliar texts was statistically significantly different, t (27) = -4.83, p =. 001. The effect size (η² = .46) was also large. For the differences between groups, when reading The Railway Children, the T-group read significantly faster than the G-group, F(1, 52) = 5.01, p = .030). Cohen’s d was used to calculate the effect size, and it was large, d = 0.832 . A significant difference was also found between the two groups reading the text selected from Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings, F (1, 52) = 6.49, p = .014; d = 0.71. The effect size was medium in strength. Overall, the results were found consistent within and between groups—students read faster on the text with which they were familiar. Table 5. Mean scores and standard deviation of the reading speeds of the two groups on two reading passages Reading texts T-group (n =25) G-group (n =28) The Railway Children Mean 142 (16.97) 128 (26.84)) Min-Max 115-186 90-197 Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings Mean 126 (23.24) 146 (34.46) Min-Max 71-163 83-206 Reading comprehension The second research question examined the reading comprehension levels when reading familiar versus unfamiliar passages. The reliabilities (Cronbach’s α) for the two sets of reading tests 1 Cohen (1988) classified the effect sizes into small, medium, and large by using cut-off points at .01, .06, and .14. 2 Cohen’s d is calculated by the standard deviation units. An effect size of 0.2 is small, 0.5 medium, and 0.8 large. Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 11 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) were .85 for Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings and .82 for The Railway Children. To compare the differences between the two groups, Table 6 shows that the T-group comprehended 76.71% for the passage The Railway Children, and 70.56% for the passage Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings. The difference was 6.15 percentage points and was statistically significant, t (24) = 2.57, p = .02; the effect size calculated with eta squared was large (η 2 = .22). The G-group achieved 58.33% for the passage The Railway Children and 70.71% for the passage Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings. It is apparent that the G-group scored 12 percentage points higher on the familiar text than on the unfamiliar one, and the difference was statistically significant, t (27) = -5.32 p < .001, and the effect size was very large (η2 = .51). To compare the differences between the two groups, a one-way ANOVA was conducted. When reading The Railway Children, the T-group comprehended 76.71%, whereas the comprehension level for the G-group was only 58.33%. There was a significant difference between the two groups in their comprehension levels, F (1, 52) = 39.09, p < .001, and the effect size calculated with Cohen’s d was medium, d = 0.71. When reading Sherlock Holmes and The Sport of Kings, the two groups comprehended comparably, 70.56% and 70.71% for the T-group and the G-group respectively, F (1,52) = .002, p = .97. The effect size was marginal, d = 0.01. Table 6.

The results show that six items in both groups scored 4 or higher on the 7-point scale, which meant that both groups responded positively to narrow reading. Using a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level of 0.025, significant statistical differences were found with items 1, 4 and 6. The T-group perceived that reading became easier (Item 1) and they comprehended better (Item 4) after reading the first book. The group also noticed that there were a number of words repeatedly occurring (Item 6). Item 5 is a reverse item exploring whether students felt bored by the input. The T-group scored an average of 2.76/7, and 3.57/7 for the G-group, which further suggested that both groups did not consider themselves bored when they read the same title three times or read three books of the same genre.

However, when they read unfamiliar or unrelated texts, both groups read at about the same rate as they read the passage in the pretest. Students’ higher reading rates for related texts were also consistent with their responses in the questionnaire (see Table 7), in which 68% of the students in the T-group, and 64% in the Ggroup responded positively that they read faster. Although about one-third of the students in each group answered not sure, very few students gave negative responses. The results provided strong evidence that reading related texts increased reading speed more efficiently than reading unrelated texts. The answer to the first question was therefore positive, as both groups read much faster with related texts. There are a number of variables that may affect reading rates such as reading purpose, text complexity, and text difficulty relative to an individual’s reading ability, and in this study the major variable may have been reading purpose. The fact that students would be assessed for their comprehension levels after reading may have substantially affected their reading rates. They may have read much faster if they were reading only for general comprehension. Regardless of this, if we compare the differences in reading rates between related and unrelated texts, we find that the students in the present study read 16–18 wpm faster after the treatment of reading three related texts within a 3-week period. The difference was impressive, indicating that narrow reading is efficient in improving reading rates. In Iwahori’s study (2008), her students read 28 books and gained 29 wpm during the 7-week period. The higher gain in the present study could be due to the fact that the texts in the present study were a series of related texts, whereas random texts were used in Iwahori’s study. Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 13 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) The reading rates for unfamiliar texts in the two groups were 126 and 128 wpm, which were similar to the rate at which they read the passage in the pretest: 123 and 128 wpm for the Tgroup and G-group respectively. The significant differences in reading rates for reading related versus unrelated texts suggested that the faster reading speeds for related texts had not yet been transferred to reading unrelated texts during the 3-week period or by reading only three graded readers. To see the transferring effect from familiar to unfamiliar texts takes time because learning is not linear and students may have to read a certain quantity (i.e., 300,000 words, see Nishizawa, Oshioka, & Fukada (2010) for a long-term study) to see its effect. Compared to previous ER studies that looked at both reading rates and comprehension, it was found that most L2 readers read at very slow rates before the treatment, mostly at 100 wpm or below. After the treatment, some read at 120 wpm (Al-Homound & Schmitt, 2009; Bell, 2001; Beglar et al., 2012). Students in the present study, however, read faster than these previous studies after reading three related long texts. The results suggested the efficiency of narrow reading on improving reading rates. Reading comprehension Although the variation patterns of reading rates were similar between the T-group and G-group when they read related or unrelated texts, their reading comprehension levels did not seem to change the same way as with their reading rates. If the acceptable level for general reading comprehension in speed reading is 70% (Nation, 2005), then the two groups’ comprehension levels on reading related texts could be considered satisfactory, but less so for the G-group, who scored much lower for the unrelated text, at only 58%. The G-group’s comprehension level seemed to have suffered when they read The Railway Children at 128 wpm. Despite this evidence, it was not easy to determine whether the comprehension levels were satisfactory. The students were aware that they would be tested after reading and were not allowed to refer back to the text they had read. Under these circumstances, it seemed that students were reading for learning, or even for memorization. It was also observed that the students’ reading purposes varied—some for rauding, some for learning, and some for memorizing. For example, the first researcher noted that one of the top students in the T-group read very slowly in order to obtain a high mark on the comprehension test. The higher level of comprehension was the goal the student wanted to achieve rather than faster reading speed. Apart from the students’ reading purposes, the researchers considered another possible reason not mentioned by the participants: The questions developed for The Railway Children contained more details. Inclusion of detailed questions was to ensure that the information mentioned in the post-test had not appeared in the previous three books. However, some questions might have been too detailed to measure reading speed and general comprehension. This might have compromised the comprehension results of the G-group reading the unfamiliar text. On the contrary, it is likely that the comprehension test based on Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings contained fewer detailed questions, so test questions were less difficult for the T-group to answer. Despite this possibility, findings related to the second research question confirmed that the reading comprehension levels in both groups were statistically higher when they read familiar texts. Comparing the two groups’ responses to questionnaire Items 1 and 4, we found that the T-group rated at significantly higher levels than the G-group, although both groups’ mean scores were on Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 14 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) the positive side. The T-group perceived that reading became easier for them and they comprehended more after reading the first book. Furthermore, the results of questionnaire Item 3 indicated that 64% of the students in the T-group responded that they had become more confident, whereas only 39% in the G-group reported so. The other 46% in the G-group, however, were not sure whether they had become more confident or not. That the T-group scored nearly the same as the G-group when they read the unrelated text (Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings) might be due to their reported higher level of confidence. The confidence might have come from repeatedly reading the same title, as repeated reading has been found to be effective in increasing reading speed and comprehension in both the L1 context (Dowhower, 1987) and in the L2 context (Chang & Millett, 2013). Students who had confidence in reading might have found it easier to transfer their reading skills to an unfamiliar text at a comfortable speed and reach a more reasonable comprehension level. Many students in the T-group also commented in the questionnaire that they liked repeatedly reading the same title. One student wrote: “I liked it. Most characters are the same. Many words reoccurred, such as tunnel, petticoat, wave, etc.” Another student noted: “It was quite interesting. I’ve never read the same title three times. Each time I gained some different information.” Another simply wrote: “Wonderful, I liked it.”3 Student perceptions of narrow reading The student perceptions of the two forms of input were positive, but the two groups perceived the input differently on Items 1, 4, and 6. The first item asked whether students felt the reading was easier after reading the first book. To be more specific, the researchers intended to determine whether students could move from Level 1 to Level 2 and then to level 3 more easily because the texts were either of the same genre or the same title. Nearly half (48%) of the students in the Tgroup mostly or entirely agreed that after reading the first book, reading the second book was easier, and another 28% also somewhat agreed with the statement. More interestingly, the same percentage (48%) of students mostly or entirely agreed that they comprehended more after reading the first book—96% of the responses were on the positive side. Many students commented that reading the same title but at different levels made the learning more gradual because the Penguin reader was very easy, contained only a few unknown words, and the scenario was easy to understand. When they moved to the Compass reader, they felt they had already learned many words, and the Compass reader also bolded the target words, making them stand out. Many more details appeared in the Oxford reader. The first researcher noticed the students’ excitement when they gained more details about the story. Some students even made a list of differences among the three books. Item 6 addressed the noticing of repeated words. Students in the T-group could easily give a long list of words that recurred across the three texts, for example, coal, petticoat, tunnel, platform, porter, pram, station master, engine, and wave. On the contrary, the students in the G-group had to think very hard to recall the repeated words, and most students listed only a few words—Holmes, Watson, crime, and murder or murderer. One student wrote: “Though the three stories were all about Sherlock Holmes, the story scenarios are different; only Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson appeared in all the three books.” This comment may suggest that G-group students had less similar background knowledge to support their reading even though they were reading texts of the same genre. 3 First researcher’s translation from students’ comments in Chinese. Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 15 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) There was no significant difference between the two groups for Items 2, 3, 5, and 7. Item 2 addressed reading speed. The mean scores of the two groups’ perceptions were 5.08 and 4.82 out of 7 for the T- and G-groups respectively. Both were on the positive side. Their perceptions were consistent with their reading rates of reading related texts. Item 3 explored whether they became more confident after reading the first related text. Both groups responded positively and no significant difference was found. However, a large proportion (64%) of the T-group students selected agree, while nearly half (46%) of the G-group students chose not sure. Item 5 concerned whether the books were boring. Students in both groups disagreed with the statement. The most likely reason that students considered the input interesting was that they had had little previous experience in learning English through stories. Before the treatment, all their reading experience was form-focused instruction. Finally, Item 7 required students to state whether they encountered many repeated phrases in the texts and to list them. Approximately half of the students in both groups responded not sure. Most students could not remember any phrases that occurred repeatedly. The answer to the third research question was that both groups found the input interesting and perceived improvement in their reading speed, but only the Tgroup perceived improvement in comprehension level and noticed repeated vocabulary items. Conclusion This study explored the reading fluency and perceptions of two groups of EFL students, each group reading either three same-title or three same-genre graded readers. The same-title graded readers were written at different levels and while they contained the same scenario, the details of the story scenario and the difficulty of language increased and this helped students to perceive that they comprehended better and noticed more recurring vocabulary words in the texts. The same-genre group, however, had to use different background knowledge because there were fewer similarities among the three different stories. Although there were some differences in text organization, both groups showed that they read faster with related texts than with unrelated ones. These results may have some important pedagogical implications in teaching beginner readers to develop L2 reading fluency: a. Choosing texts that are related to each other enables L2 learners to read faster. Earlier corpus-driven studies have shown that reading related stories lowers the lexical load for L2 learners, which enables them to comprehend better. This empirical study has provided further evidence that L2 learners are able to read faster and enjoy reading more with related texts. Given these results, selecting related materials that can facilitate students’ learning is an important task for L2 teachers. If extensive reading is also a part of the curriculum, L2 teachers can guide students, in particular beginner learners (See McQuillan & Tse, 1998) to choose same-series graded readers written by the same author or in the same genre. The availability of using same-title readers written at different language levels may be limited to the classic readers. b. Narrow reading enables students to move faster from a lower level to a higher level. A recent study by Webb and Chang (2015) showed that lower level students may have to read many lower level texts before they move to the higher levels. The students in this study seemed to Chang & Millett: Narrow reading: Effects on EFL learners’ reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions 16 Reading in a Foreign Language 29(1) move easily from lower levels to higher levels through narrow reading. Some suggestions for future research are made before the end of this conclusion. First, the study had only one trial and the participants’ positive feedback on the input might be due to the novelty of the learning method. Future studies may repeat the experiment a few times to examine whether students’ perceptions remain positive. Second, though the T-group noticed a number of repeated words, the study did not look at vocabulary gains. Future studies may include this aspect to shed more light on this under-researched area. Third, the study did not include delayed posttests, which might show if retention rates are affected after a period of time without input. The present study was conducted as part of the English curriculum, which meant that the students had to continue reading. Therefore, it was not possible to implement delayed posttesting. In future studies, it may be possible to schedule the treatment so that a posttest and a delayed posttest are conducted prior to and after a break or holiday. By doing so, we may be able to see the extent to which reading rates are maintained. Acknowledgments We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

Administrators split the participants into two groups: the title-group (T-group) and the genre-group (G-group). **Effect Sizes:** Effect sizes were computed using eta squared (η²) and Cohen's d for comparisons within and between groups. Effect size provides a measure of the strength of the difference between two groups or the strength of a relationship. - For reading rates within groups, the effect sizes were very large: η² = .34 for the T-group and η² = .46 for the G-group when reading related texts versus unrelated texts. - When comparing between groups, effect sizes measured by Cohen's d were large for reading The Railway Children (d = 0.83), and medium for reading Sherlock Holmes and The Sport of Kings (d = 0.71). The effect size in comprehension level between the groups was medium when reading The Railway Children (d = 0.71). **Other Important Measures:** - Reading Rate: Measured in words per minute (wpm). The T-group read The Railway Children at an average speed of 142 wpm and Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings at 126 wpm. The G-group read The Railway Children at 128 wpm and Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings at 146 wpm. - Reading Comprehension: Calculated in percentages, with the reliability (Cronbach’s α) for the comprehension tests being .85 for Sherlock Holmes and .82 for The Railway Children. The T-group comprehended 76.71% for The Railway Children and 70.56% for Sherlock Holmes and the Sport of Kings. The G-group's comprehension was 58.33% for The Railway Children and 70.71% for Sherlock Holmes. - Student Perceptions: A questionnaire assessed student perceptions of narrow reading, with items covering ease of reading, reading speed, confidence, and comprehension. There was a positive response to narrow reading, particularly from the T-group. The study compared the effects of two types of narrow reading treatment (same-title and same-genre reading) on reading speed, comprehension, and perceptions.

If you're considering setting up a blind date between a friend and a girl you have a crush on, it's important to carefully consider your feelings and intentions. Here are some things to think about: 1. **Your Motivation**: Why are you considering setting them up? Are you trying to see if she's interested in dating in general, or are you avoiding expressing your own feelings due to fear of rejection? 2. **Your Feelings**: It's natural to feel a bit jealous or regretful if you set your crush up with a friend and they hit it off. Are you prepared to handle these emotions if things go well between them? 3. **Friendship Dynamics**: Could setting them up potentially alter your friendship dynamics? Whether things go well or not, it's possible that it could create tension or complications within your group of friends. 4. **Respect for Her Autonomy**: The girl you have a crush on has her own preferences and the right to choose who she wants to date. Setting her up on a blind date should only happen with her interests and comfort in mind. 5. **Honesty in Relationships**: If you're interested in her, the more straightforward and honest approach might be to express your feelings to her directly. This tends to be a more genuine and respectful way to explore a potential romantic connection. If after considering these points, you still think setting them up is the right choice, you should make sure: - Your friend is someone you trust and who would be a good match for your crush. - Both parties are genuinely interested in going on a blind date. - You’ve disclosed to both parties that you are simply helping friends meet without any hidden agendas. Remember, clear communication and respect for everyone's feelings are key in such delicate situations. If you're unsure, it might be worth discussing your thoughts with a close, trusted friend for advice that's more tailored to your specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"I thought it was a good woman to introduce her to my friend because she is the woman I love.","response":"Introducing the woman you love to your friend for a potential romantic engagement can be a complex and emotionally fraught situation. It's important to be honest with yourself about why you're considering this. If your intention is to see her happy, and you genuinely believe your friend could be a great match for her, that could be generous and selfless thinking. However, it's crucial to examine your motives and the possible consequences of this action: 1. **Unresolved Feelings**: If you have unexpressed feelings for this woman, facilitating a relationship between her and your friend may lead to emotional pain for you in the long run. You might struggle seeing them together, which could lead to feelings of regret or resentment. 2. **Relationship Risks**: If the blind date doesn't turn out well, it might put your friendship and your relationship with this woman at risk. It could also potentially create awkwardness in your social circle. 3. **Communication**: If you haven't shared your feelings with her, consider why you haven't and whether there might be a good time to have an honest conversation about your emotions. 4. **Friend's Feelings**: Make sure your friend is interested in this woman for the right reasons and that his intentions are genuine. Also, consider how the outcome of this potential blind date could affect your friendship. 5. **Her Feelings and Autonomy**: You should respect her agency in deciding whom she wants to date. Enabling her to make informed decisions by being up-front about your own feelings might be more respectful in the long term. Before you take any steps, it might be helpful to talk to a different friend or a trusted person for perspective. If you choose not to pursue her romantically, ensure that setting her up with your friend is not a decision you'll regret. Ultimately, transparent communication and respecting everyone's feelings, including your own, is key to managing such sensitive matters."},{"prompt":"你是一个资深的股票分析师，总结下面的资讯，给出重点的信息，简述给我： style=\\"display:none;height:1px;overflow:hidden;\\"><br /></p><!-- EM_StockImg_Start --><p fy=\\"off\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"><a href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/sz002410.html\\" data-code=\\"002410|0|2\\" data-code2=\\"002410|0|6|\\" class=\\"EmImageRemark\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src='https://webquoteklinepic.eastmoney.com/GetPic.aspx?nid=0.002410&imageType=KNEWS3' width='578' height='' style='border:#d1d1d1 1px solid;' /></a></p><!-- EM_StockImg_End --><center style=\\"text-align:left;\\"><div class=\\"em_adv_mods\\" type=\\"1\\" tag=\\"6\\" style=\\"display:none;\\"></div></center><p>近日，<span id=\\"stock_0.002410\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/0.002410.html\\">广联达</a></span><span id=\\"quote_0.002410\\"></span>被传将全体员工年终绩效强制清零，由此引发员工不满。就此，一位脉脉认证为<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/0.002410.html\\">广联达</a></span>在职员工的人士向财联社记者透露：“（此前）口头通知是全员归零，内外网抗议后，总裁办不得已又发了一封邮件，表明可以（将）经营团队（高层管理团队）年度奖金清零。”据该人士提供的《总裁办公会致全体员工的公开信》，<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\">广联达</span>称，“结合当前对2023年财务结果的预估，公司会根据绩效结果对员工进行相应激励。公司经营管理团队对整体经营结果担责，公司经营管理团队年度奖金为零。”对此，记者于今日上午联系了广联达方面，但截至发稿前未获回复。 <br /></p><center><img src='https://np-newspic.dfcfw.com/download/D24658722001280671581_w1080h6372.jpg' width='580' height='' style='border:#d1d1d1 1px solid;padding:3px;margin:5px 0;' /></center><p fy=\\"off\\" class=\\"em_media\\">（文章来源：财联社）","response":"广联达近日被传将全体员工年终绩效强制清零，引发员工不满。但根据广联达公司的公开信，经营管理团队年度奖金为零，是基于对2023年财务结果的预估和对整体经营结果的担责。目前公司尚未回复此事。这则消息的重点是广联达公司将对员工进行相应的激励，经营管理团队的年度奖金将全清零。"},{"prompt":"hello","response":"Hello!

Here are some factors that can influence how much a stock can fall in a day: 1. **Circuit Breakers**: Many stock exchanges have automatic halts known as circuit breakers that temporarily stop trading if the price of a stock, or the overall market, falls by a certain percentage. These are in place to manage volatility and give investors time to digest information and make informed decisions. For example, in the United States, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has three levels of circuit breakers that would halt trading market-wide if the S&P 500 falls by 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), or 20% (Level 3). Individual securities may also have their own circuit breakers. 2. **Daily Price Limits**: Some exchanges, particularly for futures and options markets, have daily price limits that prevent a stock or contract from moving beyond a specified price range in a single trading session. 3. **No Upside/Downside Limits**: Some markets or stocks may not have any limits on how much a stock can fall in a day. This can be common in less regulated markets or with stocks traded over-the-counter (OTC). 4. **Market Conditions**: During times of extreme market stress or panic, stocks can fall dramatically within a short period. In the absence of regulatory curbs, market sentiment and the dynamics of supply and demand can cause significant fluctuations in stock prices. 5. **Volatility Halts**: Individual securities may have trading halted by the exchange if they experience a significant price move either up or down within a short period. These halts are typically shorter than circuit breakers and are meant to prevent disorderly markets. 6. **After Hours Trading**: In after-hours trading, where there is typically less volume and liquidity, securities can experience larger percentage moves than during the regular trading session. In extraordinary cases, such as with the Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, stocks and indices can experience very rapid and deep declines within minutes, although these are often quickly corrected. It's important to be aware that while there may be rules in place to limit extreme intraday moves, there can still be substantial risk to holding stocks, especially in volatile markets or during economic downturns. Investors should always be aware of the conditions and rules that apply to the securities they are trading."},{"prompt":"How much can a stock fall in a day? In India","response":"In India, the stock markets are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the primary stock exchanges are the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Similar to other markets, India's stock exchanges have mechanisms in place to prevent extreme volatility and protect against erratic price movements. These mechanisms include circuit breakers and price bands. **Circuit Breakers:** The Indian stock market has circuit breakers at three levels for the broad market indices like the BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty: - If the index falls 10%, trading is halted for 45 minutes if the movement occurs before 1:00 PM. If such a movement occurs at or after 1:00 PM but before 2:30 PM, trading is halted for 15 minutes. If the index falls by this percentage at or after 2:30 PM, there is no halt in trading and the market continues to operate normally. - If the index falls 15%, trading is halted for 1 hour and 45 minutes if the movement occurs before 1:00 PM. If such a movement occurs at or after 1:00 PM but before 2:00 PM, the halt is for 45 minutes. If the movement occurs at or after 2:00 PM, trading is halted for the remainder of the day. - If the index falls 20%, trading is halted for the day, regardless of the time of the movement. **Price Bands:** For individual securities, SEBI has mandated price bands to limit the volatility of a security within a single trading day. Except for stocks on which derivative products are available and stocks included in indices on which derivative products are available, there are different price bands set for stocks as follows (as of my last update): - For stocks that have traded for more than six months, a dynamic price band of 20% is applicable. This can either be expanded to 10% in either direction if the trading price reaches or surpasses the existing price band. - For newly listed stocks, the price bands for the first trading day are set at 20%. - Certain illiquid securities, which are categorized under \\"Trade for Trade\\" segment, have a fixed price band of 5%. Stock exchanges may relax the daily movement limits for certain stocks based on specific criteria. For stocks that have derivative products available or are part of the index on which derivative products are available, there are no specific price bands, allowing them to move more freely based on market demand and supply. Please note that regulations and policies may change, and it is essential to refer to the latest guidelines provided by SEBI, BSE, and NSE for the most current information."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She reaches back to scratch it, and feels a zipper. she takes hold of it, then unzips her head, before pulling it off, revealing Sombra underneath, smiling.","response":"In the ever-bustling world of Overwatch, the heroes rarely caught a moment of respite. But Tracer, ever the bundle of energy and cheer, still found joy in the small moments between skirmishes. On a rare quiet evening, after a particularly trying mission, Tracer, whose real name was Lena Oxton, finally laid her head down, eyelids heavy with the weight of exhaustion. The adrenaline of the day’s events had worn off, leaving behind a peaceful silence as she drifted into a deep sleep. Tucked away in her subconscious, Tracer navigated a realm of delusion orchestrated by her own mind’s need for rest. Her dreams were vivid but oddly mundane—a stark contrast to the high-stakes reality she was accustomed to living. She dreamt of rising from bed, the sun filtering through the blinds—unequivocally real, and yet so perfectly ordinary that she didn't second-guess the reality. She wandered over to the bathroom, her steps languid and unhurried. A reflection greeted her from the mirror, the familiar sight of the spiky-haired hero she always saw. She leaned in closer, examining the fatigue that painted her face. This isn't right, Lena thought. I never get tired. But dreams are seldom the place for logic. An itch at the back of her neck pulled her attention away from the scrutinizing eye she had aimed at her reflection. She reached back, expecting to find a tag or a rogue strand of hair, but her fingers stumbled upon something altogether unexpected—the small, metal teeth of a zipper. Her heart thrummed erratically. The detachment she felt from her dream-controlled limbs dissolved as her hands, trembling now with a blend of horror and curiosity, gripped the zipper. She paused, questioning the reality of her actions. Surely this couldn't be happening... Could it? But the tactile sensation of the zipper’s ridges was undeniably real to her dream-warped senses. She took a breath, the atmosphere growing impossibly tense around her as her fingers tugged at the zipper, the sound shockingly loud in the bathroom’s silence. The motion went smoothly, deceptively simple for such a monstrous action—unzipping her very head from her body. As the zipper peeled away from her neck, a cool draft prickled at the seam where her skull should have connected to her spine, replaced instead by the inexplicable void. She felt no pain, only a bizarre detachment that made her grip on the zipper falter. Yet, the deed was done, and the head that looked so much like her own was peeled away in her hands. Mirrors didn't lie, not in dreams nor in waking. And so, when Lena—no, Tracer—looked back into the reflective surface, she saw not her own shocked expression, but the glittering eyes and mischievous smile of another. Sombra. The enigmatic hacker stood where Tracer had been mere moments ago, the familiar jacket and chronal accelerator in place, a disarming smirk across her features. She looked at Tracer—or what was left of her, a body without a head, which bizarrely, could still see and hear. “Ay, chica,” Sombra teased, her voice tinged with the satisfaction of a prank well played. “Didn't expect to find me in here, did you?” Tracer wanted to scream, wanted to demand answers, but she had no mouth. She was an observer trapped in a spectacle of her own creation, unable to alter the course of her imagined nightmare. Sombra chuckled, twirling the disc of the chronal accelerator thoughtfully. “Maybe it’s time for you to wake up,” she mused, tapping the side of the device as though it were a mundane alarm clock. And with the subtle hint of Sombra's playfulness lingering in the air and the rush of disorientation flooding her senses, Tracer jolted awake. She gasped, her breathing ragged and her neck intact. As the vestiges of the dream faded, replaced by the familiar sounds of Overwatch headquarters coming to life for another day of heroism, Lena knew it wasn’t just a simple dream or nightmare. It felt like a message, a game of wits played across the dreamscape by an adversary with just the right amount of audacity to do so. With her pulse still racing, Tracer leapt from her bed and ran her hand across the back of her neck, half-expecting to feel the coarse metal of a zipper. Relieved to find nothing but skin, she shot a wary glance at her own reflection. Just Lena Oxton—no hidden enemies in sight. Yet the feeling lingered, the enigmatic whisper of a challenge, and somewhere in the shadows of her mind, Tracer could almost hear Sombra's parting words: \\"Boop.\\" The day was off to an unsettling start for Tracer, but if it was a trickster's battle that Sombra wanted, then it was a battle she’d get. After all, Lena Oxton was never one to back down from a challenge, especially when it came wrapped in the enigma of a hacker's dream."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Firstly, could you please provide me with the specific details of the bank account to which I should make the payment for the transfer fee? It is essential for me to verify the validity of the account and ensure that the funds are reaching the intended destination. Additionally, I’m a bit confused about the charges you have mentioned. While I understand that a certain fee is required to proceed with the transfer, I find the amount of 200 for a bank-to-bank transfer fee unusually low, especially when compared to the charges imposed by delivery services like DHL, FedEx, and UPS. Is there a reason why the bank-to-bank transfer fee is significantly lower? I want to ensure that my funds are being handled by a reliable and reputable institution. Moreover, since you mentioned the authorization from the United Nations, could you please provide any supporting documents or reference numbers to validate this claim?

I must say, I am quite relieved to finally receive this email as I have been waiting for quite some time to claim my rightful inheritance. I appreciate you providing different options for the fund transfer. However, given the magnitude of this amount, I believe it would be safest to opt for a bank-to-bank transfer. To me, this method not only ensures a secure transaction but also provides a paper trail for future reference. Therefore, I kindly request you to proceed with the bank-to-bank transfer option as mentioned in option (4). Regarding the charges, I understand that these are necessary to facilitate the transfer process. However, it appears that the cost of these delivery services is quite high. Is it possible to negotiate these fees or explore alternative delivery options? I would appreciate any effort made to reduce the expenses associated with the transfer. Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in this matter. I eagerly await your response and the next steps to claim my funds.

I am eager to proceed with this transaction and secure my funds as soon as possible. However, before I make the payment for the bank-to-bank transfer, I have a few concerns that I hope you can address. As someone who values transparency and security in financial transactions, I would appreciate some clarifications. Firstly, could you please provide me with the specific details of the bank account to which I should make the payment for the transfer fee? It is essential for me to verify the validity of the account and ensure that the funds are reaching the intended destination. Additionally, I’m a bit confused about the charges you have mentioned. While I understand that a certain fee is required to proceed with the transfer, I find the amount of 200 for a bank-to-bank transfer fee unusually low, especially when compared to the charges imposed by delivery services like DHL, FedEx, and UPS. Is there a reason why the bank-to-bank transfer fee is significantly lower? I want to ensure that my funds are being handled by a reliable and reputable institution. Moreover, since you mentioned the authorization from the United Nations, could you please provide any supporting documents or reference numbers to validate this claim? It is crucial for me to have all the necessary information to cross-check and ensure the legitimacy of this transaction. I apologize for the inconvenience caused by my inquiries, but as you know, scams and fraudulent activities are prevalent, and I want to be cautious to protect my interests. I hope you understand my concerns and can provide me with the required information to alleviate any doubts. Once I have received the requested details and verified their authenticity, I will promptly proceed with the payment for the bank-to-bank transfer fee. I eagerly await your response and the clarifications I have requested. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

The data model used within Cognite Data Fusion is designed to handle the complexities and scale of industrial data. Here's an overview of its data modeling concepts: 1. **Asset Hierarchy**: At the core of CDF's data model is the asset hierarchy. It represents the physical and logical structure of an industrial operation, breaking it down into components like equipment, parts, and systems. This hierarchical structure allows for organizing all relevant data points in a way that reflects the real-world interrelationships. 2. **Data Objects**: CDF uses various data objects to model different aspects of the industrial environment. Key objects include: - **Assets**: Represent physical items, such as machines, equipment, or parts. - **Time Series**: Store chronological data like sensor readings and telemetry. - **Events**: Represent occurrences over a period with start and end times, such as maintenance activities. - **Files**: Include documents, images, and other file-based information. - **Sequences**: Used for storing series of data that don't fit the time series model, such as logs or tabular data. 3. **Relationships**: CDF models the connections and interdependencies between different assets and data points. These relationships are essential for context and understanding how different parts of the operation affect one another. 4. **Data Types and Structures**: CDF incorporates a wide range of data types and structures relevant to industrial settings, such as measurement readings, text data from logs, and metadata. 5. **Semantic Layers**: To provide context, CDF layers semantic information on top of the raw data. This enables users to not only access data but also understand what it means in the context of their operations. 6. **Flexible Schema**: Rather than enforcing a rigid schema, CDF's data modeling is flexible. This approach allows for accommodating different sources of data without needing to fit everything into a predefined structure, which can be particularly useful in complex and varied industrial settings. By using these data modeling principles, Cognite Data Fusion facilitates the integration, accessibility, and analysis of industrial data at scale. It helps businesses leverage their data more effectively and apply advanced analytics, machine learning, and AI to derive insights and optimizations for their operations. For the most accurate and detailed explanation of CDF's data modeling, one should refer to the latest documentation provided by Cognite, as their system capabilities and features may evolve over time."},{"prompt":"cognite data fusion explain its data modelling","response":"Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) is an industrial DataOps platform created by Cognite, a company specializing in data integration and digital transformation solutions for heavy-asset industries like oil and gas, manufacturing, shipping, and power generation. The platform is designed to collect, process, and analyze large volumes of industrial data to improve operational efficiency, safety, and decision-making. Data modeling in Cognite Data Fusion is an essential feature that allows users to construct a digital representation of their physical assets and operations. This representation is often referred to as a digital twin. The data model in CDF is built around several core concepts: 1. **Resources:** At the heart of CDF's data model are resources, which are entities that hold data. Examples include assets, time series, events, and files. Each resource type contains various attributes and metadata that describe the particular entity. 2. **Assets:** These represent physical objects or systems (e.g., pumps, valves, machinery) within an industrial operation. Assets are organized in a hierarchy that reflects the real-world structure of operations. This hierarchy allows users to navigate and manage the relationships and dependencies between different components of their operations. 3. **Time series:** Time series data is vital for industrial operations, capturing measurements, and sensor data over time. In CDF, time series are associated with assets and can include data like temperature readings, pressure values, vibration levels, etc. 4. **Events:** Events represent occurrences or actions that have a start time and, optionally, an end time. They might include maintenance activities, downtime, alarms, or any other significant occurrence within the operation. 5. **Files:** Various file types (such as images, documents, or manuals) can be associated with specific assets or events to provide additional context and information. 6. **Relationships:** One of the critical aspects of CDF’s data model is the ability to define relationships between different resources. For example, a time series can be linked to the asset it measures, and an event can be linked to the asset it impacts. This provides a comprehensive view of how different aspects of the operation interact with one another. 7. **Data ingestion and transformation:** Data is ingested into CDF from various sources including, IoT devices, existing databases, and business systems. Once ingested, the data can be contextualized by mapping it against the defined models and transformed to fit the user's analytic or operational needs. 8. **Semantic layer:** CDF also provides a semantic layer that helps map disparate data sources into a uniform structure, which makes it easier for users to perform analytics and gain insights. 9. **Extensibility:** Users can extend and customize the data model based on their specific requirements. Custom resource types and extensions can be created to enhance the model further. By using these data modeling concepts, Cognite Data Fusion provides a platform that can efficiently manage complex industrial datasets, offer meaningful insights, and support the creation of applications that can interact with the digital representations of physical assets in real time. This helps businesses improve maintenance strategies, predict equipment failures, and optimize production processes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

That was the time it took for Kang Woojin to arrive at the shop and get his hair and makeup done. Of course, it didn't finish in just one hour, but it was almost at the final stage. Sitting in front of the mirror, Kang Woojin was relatively calm. 'Yeah, my face looks good today too. It's almost like magic.' He was simply praising his own transformed state. However, about an hour ago, the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel, which had just opened its lid, was undergoing a drastic tectonic shift, unlike its peaceful owner. The 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel, which had a soft opening, had roughly 100 subscribers. Even that was just in case someone might subscribe. But now, it was different. A noticeable change had occurred in just one hour. [Channel Name: Kang Woojin Sub-Character] [Subscribers: 5,858] [Videos: 2] The fact that it gained over 5,000 subscribers in just one hour. Naturally, the number of subscribers was an exaggeration. The changes in the two videos uploaded to the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel were even more drastic.

And that was without any promotion. This was purely Kang Woojin's firepower. Including all the issues he had accumulated over time, and even the recent incident with Director Kyotaro. The curiosity of the domestic audience had evolved into searches on YouTube. In other words, this was proof of Kang Woojin's high recognition. They probably tilted their heads in confusion at first. When they searched YouTube for information about Kang Woojin due to the Japanese movie incident, they unexpectedly came across his sub-character channel and his own cover song. Thanks to that. -Kang Woojin's sub-character LOLLLLLL -Is this for real???????!! Why is this real???? -.....I obviously thought it was a fake, but why is the real Kang Woojin appearing??

Anyway, thank you!! -Kang Woojin LOL When he's about to become an issue, he hurriedly uploads what he's been preparing LOL -Wow, when he hits the high notes, his voice slightly cracks, and it's full of wild charmㅠㅠ -This vocal color is something that ordinary idols really can't compete with -First video upload and already over five thousand subscribers LOL? His firepower is insane LOL? -Passing by, a Japanese language major here. This person's Japanese is as good as a native speaker. -Are you going to debut in Japan?? -Is this singing or a vocal cord, you know? -Deputy Park: Just upload one more song, it's not satisfying enough -The arrangement is damn good, and the vocals are killer. He's not just good at acting? He was a cheat character -It would be really great if this came out as a music source........... · · · · It was a mess. Just like that. Moving on. News of the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel spread quickly from hand to hand. It was first thrown into Woojin's fan club 'Kang's Heart,' and then flowed into various blogs, cafes, SNS, messengers, etc. The speed of the rumor was extraordinary. -Breaking news! Kang Woojin opened a YouTube channel (link) The Korean internet was a furnace with the issue of Director Kyotaro's 'Korean rookie actor.' The debate was endless. Therefore, the newly emerged Kang Woojin YouTube channel immediately became a hot topic. -Cheat character Kang Woojin's vocal skills + Japanese skills.GIF Posts known as 'recs' multiplied in the blink of an eye, and countless netizens were drawn to the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel as if enchanted. The number was too great to estimate. Fireworks were bursting in dozens of places. Those who were drawn in generally shared a similar atmosphere. What exactly is Kang Woojin? An actor of twists upon twists, mysterious high-level vocal skills, native-level Japanese, etc. It was an understandable reaction. Kang Woojin's path from his debut was anything but ordinary. What was peculiar here was. -Kang Woojin seems to be a Zainichi Korean. -Is this guy actually trained in acting in Japan and then moved to Korea??? A massive misunderstanding and misconception were flooding. -I figured it out, Kang Woojin is definitely an identical twinㅇㅇ Actor Kang Woojin, Singer Kang Woojin are separate. This part was unintended by both Kang Woojin and Choi Seonggeon. Regardless, the snowball's speed steepened. Meanwhile, at this time. Offline, unlike online, the situation was not yet accurately assessed. For example, many actors, including the tops gathered at a large Japanese restaurant in Seoul, were like that. It was a pre-meeting for the upcoming script reading in two days for the next work 'Freezing Love' by star writer Lee Wolseon. The pretext was a pre-meeting, but it was no different from a company dinner. Kang Woojin was also offered a spot, but due to a scheduling conflict, Woojin did not attend. Whatever it was. \\"I wonder how Kang Woojin's sign language is coming along? Did he practice well?\\" \\"It's already a difficult role, but the writer must have managed it well.\\" \\"By the way, is that really true? About Kang Woojin and Director Kyotaro.\\" For some reason, the topic of conversation among the actors was Kang Woojin. Well, it wasn't strange. Woojin was currently turning the entertainment industry upside down. They were also planning to meet him soon. \\"Ah, the rookie actor picked by Director Kyotaro? Isn't that just the journalists' speculation?\\" \\"It doesn't seem to be confirmed yet.\\" \\"This industry has seen such false alarms a time or two, right? I personally think it's not true. Maybe that rookie just got pointed out because he's hot these days?\\" \\"But I saw a post written by someone, and it seemed quite credible. Kang Woojin, that guy, won the acting award at Mise-en-scène, and the award was given by Director Kyotaro.\\" \\"Would he have taken him just because he saw that briefly?\\" If you look inside, there was a mix of jealousy and genuine curiosity. Anyway, the actors' discussion was quite heated. \\"Honestly, if you look at the works Kang Woojin has been in or is scheduled for, it's already over the top, right? Just analyzing the works and memorizing the lines would take more than half a year, so when would he have time to learn Japanese and go to Japan?\\" \\"That's what I thought was strange too. Sometimes when I see articles about Woojin, I thought he was amazing. It's only been half a year since his debut, and he's digesting all that.\\" \\"If he keeps going like this, he'll burn out quickly, let alone debuting in Japan. It's impossible unless he's an alien.\\" \\"He's already an alien with what he's achieved.\\" \\"But if Kang Woojin really is that 'rookie actor,' it would be legendary, right? It would be no different from writing an unprecedented history.\\" Divided or half-and-half. This atmosphere was not just among the actors of 'Freezing Love,' but also a general scene in the domestic entertainment industry, including the media and various broadcasters. Then, as the afternoon waned, Kang Woojin's name was crossing from Korea to Japan. A similar pattern to the tidal wave of issues that spread from Japan to Korea. -You know the Korean rookie actor that Director Tanoguchi mentioned? It seems like in Korea, it's narrowing down to an actor named Kang Woojin. -Kang Woojin? Who is that? I'm hearing about him for the first time. Is he really a rookie in Korea? -Ah! Kang Woojin! That actor! The one who appeared in the popular Netflix series 'The Prodigal'! -Are you talking about the villain actor from the first episode of 'The Prodigal'? -Kang Woojin! I was curious and looked him up, and although he's scary in dramas, he's super cute on SNS! -But it's not certain in Korea, right? It's just a rumor, not a fact. The Japanese public, who had been buzzing about 'Korea's rookie actor,' -There's a Kang Woojin SNS? Gradually began to imprint 'Kang Woojin.' They continued to search out of curiosity, even though it wasn't a fact. From the portal site to Kang Woojin's SNS. -@Wooji_n Posts: 71 Followers: 1.838 million Following: 9 And to YouTube. There were many results when searching for Kang Woojin on YouTube. Even an official channel that seemed to be owned by Kang Woojin. There were two uploaded videos. Among them, the second video was just right for the taste of Japanese netizens. -[Elani/'Ballerina: ballerina'] Cover (Cover) [Japanese.Ver] | Kang Woojin Sub-Character It was a Japanese cover song of KPOP. [Channel Name: Kang Woojin Sub-Character] [Subscribers: 24,000] [Videos: 2] The number of subscribers began to skyrocket. The next day, August 20th. The location was an event hall in a hotel in Seoul. Many tables were laid out in the center of the hall. There, dozens of reporters with large cameras were seated. There seemed to be at least 50 of them. In front of the reporters, on the stage, there was. -[Netflix 'Best Guy Friend' Production Announcement] A large poster was hung. A poster with a still image of Kang Woojin and Hwarin, along with the title 'Best Guy Friend.' The reason was simple. Currently, the official production announcement for 'Best Guy Friend' was underway in this hall. Therefore, in front of the poster, in the center of the stage, the main cast was seated. It started with director Shin Dongchun, followed by writer Choi Nana, Kang Woojin, and Hwarin. They were seated in a straight line, each holding a microphone while sitting in individual chairs. Director Shin Dongchun was quite comfortable with such occasions. On the other hand, writer Choi Nana, wearing round glasses, \\"······Phew-\\" Was completely frozen. It was her first time at a production announcement, and she was naturally nervous. Next to her, Woojin stood out. Kang Woojin, neatly dressed in a navy full suit with his hair slicked up. Throughout the production announcement, he maintained a calm expression. However, internally, he was just maintaining his composure due to the surging reporters. 'Crazy. How many are there? It's blinding, the shutters are going crazy.' Hwarin, dressed in a white dress, was as relaxed as director Shin Dongchun. Anyway, the production announcement for 'Best Guy Friend' felt a bit more relaxed than usual. It had already been over 30 minutes since it started. \\"Uh- As you know, our 'Best Guy Friend' is the start of Netflix's single-episode project, and currently, it has been confirmed to launch on Netflix in both Korea and Japan······\\" Currently, director Shin Dongchun with a square jaw was continuing the introduction of the work according to the cue sheet. Next was his ambition. It continued to writer Choi Nana. The next turn was Kang Woojin. \\"I worked hard on it. Even if it's a bit lacking, I hope you enjoy watching it.\\" Although it was a bit indifferent, it was sincere. Well, the next person, Hwarin's ambition, wasn't too long either, so the picture wasn't bad. Soon. \\"Yes! Now we'll take some questions from the reporters.\\" Following the signal from the host, dozens of reporters eagerly raised their hands. They chose which reporter to take questions from. Director Shin Dongchun opened the floodgates. \\"Yes. The reporter with the perm in the front.\\" \\"Ah, hello, director. Um- A few years ago, you suddenly left the drama scene to make movies, right? After that, you won the Mise-en-scène Grand Prize for 'Detective Agency.'\\" \\"That's correct.\\" \\"I heard that you received a lot of love calls from the entire film industry, but why did you suddenly come back to dramas? And why a single-episode drama?\\" \\"Ha, you're starting with a really deep question.\\" After laughing awkwardly, director Shin Dongchun glanced at Kang Woojin, who was sitting third, and then answered. \\"I'll answer 'because I owe Woojin a favor.'\\" Immediately, the eyes of dozens of reporters all turned to Kang Woojin. In fact, all the reporters present had their own thoughts. Naturally, they were very interested in Kang Woojin, who was full of issues. But for now, they seemed to hold back. Then, after passing writer Choi Nana's question, it was the turn of Kang Woojin, who sat with his legs crossed cynically. \\"Next, we'll take a question for Mr. Woojin!\\" -Swish. As if they had been waiting, all the reporters, numbering over 50, raised their hands eagerly. Their eyes were full of desire. To an excessive degree. To this, Woojin thought. 'What, if I say I won't take questions, will I get slapped?' Although he was inwardly disgusted, he put on a stern face. It was hard, but let's try to choose. He picked a reporter who looked the most gentle. Kang Woojin's choice was a woman reporter sitting at the far right, who seemed to have kind eyes. Soon, Woojin gestured to the woman reporter. \\"Yes, the reporter wearing a shirt at the end.\\" As soon as she was called, the woman reporter stood up with a small smile. Woojin thought it was a success. However, that thought was shattered in just one second. It was because of the unexpected question thrown by the woman reporter with the kind face. \\"Mr. Woojin. Speaking of the Japanese launch of 'Best Guy Friend,' there's speculation rampant that you are the 'Korean rookie actor' handpicked by the Japanese master Director Kyotaro. What do you think?\\" \\"······\\" \\"The media and public opinion are debating whether it's true or not, but recent public opinion seems to be leaning towards the theory that it's you, Mr. Woojin. What are your thoughts on this?\\" The woman reporter's question caused the expressions of the other dozens of reporters to light up with interest. They all had similar thoughts. However, this question was too sensitive. Therefore, director Shin Dongchun signaled the host with a glance and shook his head slightly. To cut off the question. Such scenes were common at production announcements, so the host quickly understood and was about to open his mouth to the dozens of reporters. \\"Ah- That question is.\\" \\"Yes, reporter.\\" Kang Woojin, who had calmly raised his microphone, recited in a low and indifferent tone. \\"I am indeed that 'Korean rookie actor.'\\" It was a bold statement. \\"······\\" \\"······\\" \\"······\\" A moment of silence flowed through the large hall. Everyone on the 'Best Guy Friend' team, including Hwarin, as well as the more than 50 reporters, were all stunned looking at Kang Woojin. It lasted for about 10 seconds. Then, towards Kang Woojin. -Papapapapak! -Papapapapapapak! A barrage of camera flashes poured out. < Fireworks (4) > End"},{"prompt":"< 폭죽 (6) > 10분. 쿄타로 감독 측의 공식 입장이 쏘아진 뒤, 그와 유사한 또는 거의 흡사한 기사가 일본에 깔리는 시간이었다. 『타노구치 쿄타로 감독 측이 공식 발표한 한국 배우는 「강우진」, 진짜 신인이었다』 가뜩이나 용광로 같은 이슈였다. 쿄타로 감독의 인터뷰 건으로 더 커진 논란이기도, 수많은 대중들이 관심을 가진 건이기도 했다. 『‘토에가’ 영화사 측, 캐스팅 확정된 한국 배우 「강우진」맞다』 그렇기에 일본 언론은 빛보다 빠르게 공식 입장을 복붙했다. 드디어 명확한 정답이 나온 셈. 『한국, 일본 통틀어 신인으로서 타국 영화의 주연 맡은 것은 「강우진」이 최초!』 깔끔히 해소된 궁금증에, 일본 대중들은 어쩌면 열광 반대로 투덜대기도 했다. -역시 강우진이 맞았네! 난 좋아! 이 배우 연기 잘 하거든 -이미 한국에서는 어느정도 확정되던 분위기였는데, 이럴 거면 왜 숨겼던 거야?? -잘 숨겼는데 워낙 일이 커져서 안 되겠다 싶은 게 아니었을까? -그래도 내가 좋아하는 낯선 이의 기괴한 희생에 한국 배우가 나오는 건 좀 -강우진! 너무너무 좋다! 그의 너튜브에 들어가 봐 다들 팬이 될 거야! -난 오히려 한국 배우가 나와 줘야된다고 봐, 어차피 일본 배우들은 연기가 퇴화되고 있으니까 -나도 너무 좋은데? 불만이면 넷플렉스 한량부터 보고 오던지 -대단하긴 하네....신인인데 어떻게 주연을 쟁취했을까? · · · 뭐가 됐든 이제 모든 팩트가 드러났다. 이러한 상황은 일본으로서도 유일무의했고, 대중들도 처음보는 광경이라 퍽 소란스러워진다. 물론, 일본 쪽 모두가 긍정적이진 않았다. 부정적인 시선도 많았다. 『밝혀진 ‘한국의 신인 배우’, 그러나 영화계 관계자들은 고개 갸웃』 『「강우진」이 누구야? 걱정 심화되는 네티즌들』 그러나 하나만큼은 일맥상통했다. 이 순간 일본의 언론·여론의 시선이 ‘강우진’과 ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’에 집중됐다는 것. 이름값이, 인지도가 쭉쭉 상승했다. 쌓아온 빌드업이 있기에 부스터는 기본 장착이었다. 덩달아 일본 넷플렉스의 한량 역시 자주 언급됐고. 『타노구치 쿄타로 감독의 「강우진」, 알고 보니 넷플렉스의 인기 한국 드라마 조연 배우』 일본 기자들은 이 이슈의 주인공인 강우진 관련, SNS, 너튜브 채널, 필모, 과거 작품들을 자주 다뤘다. 기본 중의 기본이긴 했다. 대중들이 클릭하는 건 최대한 많은 양의 정보가 포함되어야 하니까. 이쯤, 일본 민영 방송국 TBE에선. “PD님!!” ‘아메토크 show!’의 작가들이 신조 PD에게 달려든 참이었다. “우진씨래요!! 우진씨가 맞대요!” “네? 뭐가요?” “아니! 타노구치 쿄타로 감독이 말한 ‘한국의 신인 배우’요! 우진씨가 맞다구요!” “그게 무슨 소리···확실합니까? 추측들만 난무했고 팩트는 없었잖아요.” “방금요! 타노구치 감독이 공식 입장 발표했어요! 주연으로 낙점한 게 우진씨가 맞다고!” 순간, 빼싹 마른 신조 PD의 눈이 디립다 확장됐다. “다, 당장 bw 엔터에 연락 넣어요! 그리고 기획 짠 거 싹 가져오고!” “네넵!” “서둘러요! bw 엔터와 소통해서 우리도 최대한 빨리 기사 돌려야 되니까! 그리고 기획도 반 이상 갈아 치워야 됩니다!” ‘아메토크 show!’ 팀이 발작에 가까울 정도로 바빠진다. 그리고. 『화제인 한국의 신인「강우진」, 넷플렉스에 곧 런칭할 로코물 ‘남사친’의 주연』 마치 기다렸다는 듯, 일본 넷플렉스 측에서 곧 런칭될 ‘남사친’ 소식을 쏘아 올렸다. 더불어. 『「강우진」, 「화린」‘남사친’ 홍보 일정으로 곧 일본 내한 예정』 강우진과 화린의 일본 스케줄까지 흘렸다. -와! 강우진이랑 화린 일본 온다구?!! -진짜야?? 남사친? 이건 로코물인가? 찾아봐야겠어! -어디 공항! 몇 시에! 나도 직접 보고 싶단 말이야! 이 역시 빠르게 번졌다. 이어 다시 한국. 일본보다 핵폭탄이 먼저 터진 한국은, 오후를 지나 밤이 됐음에도 여전히 요동치고 있었다. 각종 포털사이트의 뉴스는 계속해서 바뀌며, 그 기사는 손가락을 타고 쭉쭉 뻗어 나갔다. 요란했다. 올해 들어 제일 과했다. 이쯤 되면 강우진의 주변인들이 모를 리가 없었다. 극성도 이런 극성이 없을 정도였다. 동생인 강현아는 놀라 자빠졌고 우진의 불알친구들은 단독에서 난리부르스였다. 더해서 강우진이 지금껏 스친 모든 인물들 역시 눈알이 디립다 커졌다. 감독, PD, 배우, 스탭들. 머릿수만 따져도 수백명은 가뿐히 넘는 인원들 모두는 각양각색의 리액션을 보였다. “PD님!! 기사 봤어요?! 우리 강토템이 아카리 작가 실사 영화 주연 확정이래!” “봤어 나도! 그 작품도 겁나 잘되겠구만!” “근데 우진씨는 왜 노래까지 잘하는 거예요? 이거 몰랐어? 알았으면 한량에서 OST 하나 주지 그랬어??” “난들 알았겠나!” 송만우 PD와 박은미 작가를 시작으로, 그 모두를 일일이 표현하기 힘들 정도로 흥분한 모양새였다. 결과적으로는 혼돈의 서막이 열렸다. 그래, 서막. 이건 이제 시작일 뿐이었다. 그 사이 좀 점까지 강우진과 함께였던, 지금은 자신의 벤에 타 있는 화린은 귀에 이어폰을 낀 상태였다. 이유야 심플했다. -♬♪ 강우진의 커버곡을 감상하고 있었으니까. 즉, 너튜브 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널을 확인했다. 인사말 영상에서는 실실 웃었고, 커버곡에선 감동을 금치 못한 얼굴로 급변했다. 그녀는 커버곡을 감상한 지 단 1분 만에 한 손으로 입을 틀어막았다. ‘아니! 우진님! 일본어 조금 할 줄 아는 정도라면서요??! 이게? 이게 어딜 봐서?!’ 커버곡 속 우진의 일본어는 잘하는 수준을 훌쩍 뛰어넘었다. 아니, 격이 달랐다. 그냥 눈을 감고 들으면 일본 가수라 생각이 들 정도. 최소 화린에겐 그랬다. 물론, 그녀의 판단은 틀리지 않았다. 그녀 역시 일본어는 수준급이니까. 이미 화린이 포함된 걸그룹 ‘엘라니’는 일본에서 1티어급 인기였고, 지금껏 많은 일본 스케줄을 소화해왔다. 그러니 화린 역시 일본어를 잘하는 것. ‘나는- 배운 거라 여전히 발음에서 조금 어색함이 있는데, 우진님이 하는 일본어는 그냥 현지인이야.’ 순간, 강우진의 과거가 극심하게 궁금해지는 그녀였다. 하지만 그것도 잠시. -♬♪ 화린은 강우진의 음색에 몸을 맡긴다. 정신이 혼미해진다. 심장이 미친 듯이 뛴다. ‘이 얼굴에, 이 목소리에, 이 톤으로······찢었다. 녹아, 진심으로 녹아. 전혀 우리 노래 안 같아. 너무- 좋아. 하루에 열 번. 아니, 백 번 들을래.’ 흥분한 화린의 팔뚝에 소름이 돋았다. 이건 팬심을 넘어 추앙수준이었다. ‘어떻게 매력이 까도까도 끝이 없지? 하- 진짜 덕질하기 잘한 것 같아.’ 이내 화린은 영상의 표시된 ‘좋아요’ 버튼을 연타한 뒤, ‘엘라니’의 멤버들이 모인 단톡방에 접속해 우진의 영상을 공유했다. -화린: 이거 들어봐! 100번 들어봐! 그리곤 자신의 SNS에 접속해서는. ‘이건 나만 듣긴 너무 아까워! 어차피 우진님 채널이니까 대박 나겠지만, 그래도 더 많이 들어야 돼 이 곡은.’ ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널을 뿌렸다. 21일, 아침. 시간은 10시쯤. 강우진은 한 높은 건물의 엘리베이터 앞에 서 있다. 더워진 날씨에 옷차림은 가볍다. 다만, 언제는 안 그랬냐 만은 국내와 일본 전체로 자신의 이름이 부글대고 있음에도. “······” 강우진의 얼굴엔 흔들림 없는 포커페이스가 가득했다. 뭐, 이건 컨셉보단 진심이긴 했다. ‘어우- 개피곤하네. 한 2시간 잤나? 반응 보느라 밤샐뻔했네.’ 어제 강우진은 퇴근과 함께 새벽까지 핸드폰을 붙잡고 있었으니까. 신기할 수밖에. 인터넷 어디를 들어가도 자신의 이름이 가득했으니까. 그런 그의 옆엔 아까부터 연신 전화를 받는 최성건이 바빠 보인다. “예예, 김PD님. 하하하. 감사합니다. 섭외 말이죠? 하- 근데 지금 우진씨 스케줄이요, 진짜 상반기는 어렵습니다. 하반기는 어떠세요?” 비단 지금만이 아닌 어제부터 그랬다. 강우진이 ‘남사친’ 제작발표회서 ‘노빠꾸’한 순간부터, 최성건의 핸드폰은 초마다 전화며 메시지가 쏟아졌다. 물론, bw 엔터 쪽은 더 심했다. 하지만 강우진은 최성건에게 신경 쓸 겨를이 없었다. 오늘은 스타작가 이월선의 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 대본리딩이 있는 날이었으니까. 이 높은 건물은 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 제작사가 있는 곳이며, 약 1시간 뒤엔 대본리딩이 정식으로 시작될 참. 이내 엘리베이터 층수를 바라보는 무심한 우진이 작게 숨을 뱉었다. 심호흡한 것. ‘오늘은 아는 사람이 진짜 1도 없어, 후- 사알짝 긴장되네···울렁거리기 시작했다.’ 멀미약이라도 먹어야 하나? 우진이 생각할 때 적당히 통화를 마친 최성건이 입을 열었다. “전화가 무슨 톡처럼 걸려온다. 이거 봐 또 온다 또 와. 이 지경이라 리딩장 안에는 못 들어가겄다. 뭐, 혼자라도 괜찮지? 네가 긴장 따위 할 일은 없으니까.” 아니요? 멀미약 먹고 싶은데요. 하지만 본심은 꾹꾹 숨긴 우진이 근엄히 끄덕였다. “네, 충분합니다.” 비죽 웃던 최성건이 강우진의 어깨를 두드렸다. “뭐, 대체로 너는 최초인 게 많은데 너처럼 작품 리딩을 자주하는 배우는 또 없을 거다. 것도 신인이.” “이건 작가님 때문에 참석한다고.” “어? 아- 어어. 글지. 솔직히 여기 리딩은 네가 굳이 참석 안 해도 되긴 해. 분량이 짧으니까. 그래도 이월선 작가한테 눈도장은 찍어두는 게 좋아.” “예, 저도 그렇게 생각합니다.” “이 바닥 인맥이라는 게 언제 어떻게 쓰일지 알 수가 없거든.” 답한 최성건이 현재의 리딩장 상황을 예측했다. “어으, 근데 리딩장에 배우나 스탭들이나 죄다 네 얘기 해대고 있을 거다.” “상관없습니다.” “그렇겠지, 뭐 언제는 니가 그런 거 신경이나 썼냐?” 이때. -띵! 도착한 엘리베이터가 문을 열었다. 한편, ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 리딩장 안. ㄷ자형 책상이 깔린 리딩장은 세팅이 얼추 끝난 상태였다. 이미 도착한 조연급 배우도 몇몇 보였고, 수십 스탭들은 물론이며 대여섯 기자도 눈에 띈다. 웃긴 것은. “강우진 오는 거 확실한 거지?” “아- 그렇다니까. 내가 조기 조연출한테 몇 번이나 물었다고. 정 못 믿겠으면 김기자 네가 가서 다시 물어보든지.” “운이 좋았구만. 강우진 리딩에 온다 안 온다 말이 많았는데, 특종 터지고 바로 다음 날 보다니.” 모두의 입에선 강우진의 얘기가 나오고 있다는 것. “검색사이트 봤어요? 진심 연예면 뉴스에 싹- 다 우진씨 기사던데.” “그럴만하지. 적당히 국뽕도 끼었겠다만, 애초 영화계 역사 통틀어서 처음이라잖아.” “근데 진짜 신기하긴 해요, 대체 어떻게 그 판에서 주연을 꿀떡 먹었지? 뒷배가 좋나?” “어떤 기사 보니까 재벌이란 얘기도 있드만. 연기에, 보컬에, 일본어까지. 조기교육 빡세게 받았다고.” 기자들, 스탭들, 배우들은 수군대기 바빴다. “이야- 강우진. 부럽다, 부러워. 나는 언제 해외 진출해보나.” “오빠는 일단 국내서 조연롤 이미지부터 벗어야지?” “너도 마찬가지잖아.” “어쨌든 인터넷이고 SNS고 죄다 강우진 얘기뿐이더라. 꽤 오래가겠어, 이러면 걔가 막 배우들 무시하고 그러지 않을라나?” “인성 괜찮다고 하던데.” 이 순간. -스윽. 유리문이 천천히 열리며 냉기가 담긴 얼굴의 남자가 들어섰다. 강우진이었다. 덕분에 리딩장 모두의 시선이 입구 쪽 우진에게 붙었고, 잠시간 그들을 훑던 우진이 고개 숙이며 낮게 읊조렸다. “안녕하십니까, 강우진입니다.” 일순, 리딩장이 고요해졌다. 이때 우진을 보며 약간 멍때리는 기자의 핸드폰이 눈에 띈다. 보이는 건 너튜브 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널, 아마 곧 만날 강우진 때문에 보고 있었던 듯. 흥미로운 것은 [채널명: 강우진 부캐] [구독자 50.9만 명] [동영상 2개] 속된말로 ‘개떡상한’ 구독자 수였다. 그쯤, 리딩장의 밖. 복도를 휘적휘적 도는 최성건은 여전히 핸드폰을 귀에 붙이고 있었다. 미친 듯 쏟아지는 전화. 지금의 통화 상대는 넷플렉스 코리아의 김소향이었다. “일본 홍보 일정이 26일이요?” 일본 홍보 일정이란, 일전에 그녀가 말했던 제작발표회를 빙자한 행사를 말하는 것. 일본 넷플렉스와 합작할 예정. 어쨌든 최성건의 되물음에 핸드폰 너머 김소향 총괄디렉터가 답했다. “네, 다음 달도 괜찮긴 한데, 이런 일은 최대한 빨리 잡는 게 좋다고 일본 넷플렉스 측과 의견 좁혔어요. 한창 왁자지껄할 때 들이받아야죠. 물론, 우진씨 스케줄이 맞지 않으면 방향 틀어야겠지만.” “아니요. 다음 달은 더 힘듭니다. 우진씨 스케줄이 다음 달은 지금의 두 배라. 흠- 26일.” 따지면 며칠 뒤 바로였다. 곧, 머리 속으로 계산기를 두드리던 최성건이 입을 열었다. “26일에 잡힌 스케줄이 몇 있긴 한데, 혹시 화린씨 쪽은 어떻답니까?” “어차피 하루 일정이라 괜찮다고 해요. 정 힘드시면 일본 도착은 화린씨랑 따로 하셔도 돼요. 현지에서 쪼인해도 되니까.” “아니요, 가능하면 같이 가는 그림이 예쁘죠. 알겠습니다. 제가 한 번 맞춰 볼게요.” “아! 감사해요, 그럼 저는 저대로 26일에 맞춰서 준비할게요?” “네, 총괄디렉터님.” 그렇게 통화를 마친 최성건이 다이어리를 펼쳤다. 이미 공백없이 빼곡하다. 작게 한숨 쉰 그가 뒷장을 넘겨 뭔가를 적었고. ‘26일 일본 도착. ‘남사친’ 관련 일본 홍보 스케줄 소화. 이러면- 27일에 ‘아메토크 show!’ 하고 쿄타로 감독 미팅을 잡아야겠어.‘ 다이어리를 덮은 그가 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “그리고 30일엔 ‘아메토크 show!’ 정식 녹화.” 한마디로 강우진의 이번 일본 스케줄은 하루가 아닌, 총 4일이 될 예정이었다. 30일이 ‘아메토크 show!’ 촬영인데 왔다 갔다는 번거로우니까. 뭔가 답이 나온 최성건이 이번에는 본인이 전화를 걸었다. 상대방은 ‘실종의 섬’ 제작실장이었다. “예, 실장님. 연락이 늦었습니다. 스케줄을 좀 정리한다고. 예예. 일단, 정확한 건 이번에 일본 가서 쿄타로 감독을 만난 뒤에 말씀드리겠습니다. 예. 그래도 해외로케 스케줄이 쪽날 일은 없을 겁니다, 촬영 일정도 최대한 기스 안 나게 붙일 거고.” 길게 설명하던 최성건이 마무리 멘트를 던진 뒤. “네네, 그럼 일본 다녀와서 뵙는 거로 하겠습니다. 예. 아- 그 부분은 권감독님께 직접 전화하겠습니다. 네-” -뚝. 얼추 급한 불은 껐다 싶은지 최성건이 긴 한숨을 뱉었다. “후우, 이건 뭐 혜연이 때보다 더 바쁘네. 뭐 하긴. 걔는 이렇게 일이 겹친 적도 없으니까. 정신없어도 재밌긴 해.” 그 순간. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 다시금 울리는 벨소리. 곧, 발신자를 확인한 최성건이 약간 고개를 갸웃했다. “김도희 감독?” 상대가 ‘마약상’의 김도희 감독이었으니까. 그러다 ‘우진에게 축하를 전하려나 보네’ 한 최성건이 전화를 받았다. “네, 감독님. 하하 식사는 하셨습니까?” “아니요, 이제 해야죠. 그보다 최대표님.” 그런데 핸드폰 너머 김도희 감독이 뱉은 것은 축하가 아니었다. “다음 주쯤에 ‘마약상’ 블라인드 시사회 열 건데요.” “······블라인드 시사회요?” 블라인드 시사회란, 작품의 후반 작업 끝에 있는 일정이었다. 감독 등의 제작진들 그리고 배우들만이 모여 시사회를 여는 것. 완성품의 감상이랄까? 그 말인즉슨. “네. 블라인드 시사회요. 가능하면 우진씨랑 같이 오셨으면 좋겠네요, 꼭.” ‘마약상’의 개봉이 코 앞이란 소리였다. < 폭죽 (6) > 끝","response":"< Fireworks (6) > Ten minutes. That was the time it took for similar or nearly identical articles to spread across Japan after Director Kyotaro's official statement was released. \\"The Korean actor officially announced by Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro is 'Kang Woojin,' a true rookie.\\" The issue was already hot like a furnace. It was a controversy that had grown due to Director Kyotaro's interview, and many people were interested in it. \\"Toega Film Company confirms casting of Korean actor 'Kang Woojin'\\" Thus, the Japanese media copied and pasted the official statement faster than light. Finally, a clear answer had emerged. \\"Kang Woojin is the first rookie actor from Korea or Japan to take on a leading role in a foreign film!\\" With their curiosity neatly resolved, the Japanese public was either ecstatic or grumbling in the opposite direction. -As expected, it was Kang Woojin! I like it! This actor is good at acting. -It was already somewhat confirmed in Korea, so why did they hide it?? -They hid it well, but maybe they couldn't help it because the issue became too big? -Still, I'm a bit upset that a Korean actor will appear in 'The Strange Sacrifice of the Strangers.' -Kang Woojin! I really like him! Go check out his YouTube, everyone will become a fan! -I think it's better that a Korean actor appears, since Japanese actors are regressing in their acting anyway. -I really like it too. If you have complaints, go watch 'The Prodigal' on Netflix first. -It's impressive... How did a rookie secure a leading role? · · · Whatever the case, all the facts were now revealed. This situation was unprecedented for Japan, and the public was experiencing a scene they had never seen before, causing quite a stir. Of course, not everyone in Japan was positive. There were many negative views as well. \\"The 'Korean rookie actor' has been revealed, but film industry insiders are tilting their heads.\\" \\"Who is 'Kang Woojin'? Netizens' concerns deepen.\\" However, one thing was consistent. At this moment, the focus of Japan's media and public opinion was concentrated on 'Kang Woojin' and 'The Strange Sacrifice of the Strangers.' His name value and recognition soared. There was a buildup, so the booster was naturally attached. The Netflix series 'The Prodigal' was also frequently mentioned in Japan. \\"Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro's 'Kang Woojin,' turns out to be a supporting actor in a popular Korean drama on Netflix.\\" Japanese journalists often covered Kang Woojin-related SNS, YouTube channels, filmography, and past works. It was the basics. The public clicked on articles that contained as much information as possible. Around this time, at the Japanese private broadcasting station TBE. \\"PD-nim!!\\" Writers of the 'Ametalk show!' rushed to Producer Shinjo. \\"It's Woojin! It's really Woojin!\\" \\"What? What are you talking about?\\" \\"No! The 'Korean rookie actor' that Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro mentioned! It's confirmed to be Woojin!\\" \\"Are you sure about that? There were only speculations, no facts.\\" \\"Just now! Director Tanoguchi officially announced it! He confirmed that Woojin is the lead!\\" Suddenly, Producer Shinjo's eyes widened with surprise. \\"Quickly, contact BW Entertainment! And bring all the plans we've made!\\" \\"Yes, sir!\\" \\"Hurry up! We need to communicate with BW Entertainment and get our article out as soon as possible! And we have to change more than half of our plans!\\" The 'Ametalk show!' team became as busy as if they were having a seizure. And then. \\"The trending Korean rookie 'Kang Woojin,' the lead of the soon-to-launch Netflix rom-com 'Best Guy Friend'\\" As if they had been waiting, the Japanese Netflix side launched news about the upcoming 'Best Guy Friend.' Additionally. \\"Kang Woojin and Hwarin to visit Japan soon for 'Best Guy Friend' promotional schedule\\" They also leaked the schedule for Kang Woojin and Hwarin's visit to Japan. -Wow! Kang Woojin and Hwarin are coming to Japan?!! -Really?? Best Guy Friend? Is that a rom-com? I need to look it up! -Which airport! What time! I want to see them in person too! This news spread quickly as well. Back to Korea. Korea, where the nuclear bomb of news had exploded first, was still in turmoil even as night fell. News on various portal sites kept changing, and the articles spread far and wide through clicks. It was noisy. The most excessive it had been all year. By now, it was impossible for those around Kang Woojin not to know. It was an extreme level of fervor. His sister, Kang Hyuna, was shocked, and Woojin's close friends were in a frenzy. Furthermore, everyone Kang Woojin had ever encountered was also taken aback. Directors, PDs, actors, staff members. Hundreds of people, just by headcount, showed a variety of reactions. \\"PD-nim!! Did you see the article?! Our Kang Totem is confirmed as the lead in Director Akari's live-action movie!\\" \\"I saw it too! That project is going to do really well!\\" \\"But why can Woojin sing so well? Did you know about this? If I had known, I would have given him an OST for 'The Prodigal'??\\" \\"How would I have known!\\" PD Song Manwoo and writer Park Eunmi were just the beginning; everyone was too excited to express each reaction individually. As a result, the prelude to chaos had begun. Yes, the prelude. This was just the beginning. Meanwhile, Hwarin, who had been with Kang Woojin until a moment ago and was now in her van, had earphones in. The reason was simple. -♬♪ She was listening to Kang Woojin's cover song. In other words, she had checked out the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' YouTube channel. She giggled at the greeting video and her face changed to one of deep emotion as she listened to the cover song. Just one minute into listening to the cover song, she covered her mouth with one hand. \\"No! Mr. Woojin! You said you could speak a little Japanese??! This? This is not just a little?!\\" Woojin's Japanese in the cover song far exceeded just being good. It was on a different level. If you just closed your eyes and listened, you would think it was a Japanese singer. At least that's how Hwarin felt. Of course, her judgment was not wrong. She too was proficient in Japanese. The girl group 'Elani,' which included Hwarin, was already popular at the tier-one level in Japan, and she had been handling many Japanese schedules until now. So Hwarin was also good at Japanese. \\"I learned it, so there's still a bit of awkwardness in my pronunciation, but Mr. Woojin's Japanese is just like a native speaker.\\" Suddenly, Hwarin became extremely curious about Kang Woojin's past. But that was only for a moment. -♬♪ Hwarin surrendered herself to Kang Woojin's vocal color. Her mind became hazy. Her heart raced wildly. \\"With this face, this voice, this tone... it's torn apart. I'm melting, truly melting. It doesn't even sound like our song anymore. I love it so much - I want to listen to it ten times a day. No, a hundred times.\\" Chills ran down the excited Hwarin's arms. This was beyond fandom; it was adoration. \\"How can someone have endless charm no matter how much you peel back the layers? Ah- I really think I did well becoming a fan.\\" Then Hwarin repeatedly tapped the 'like' button on the video and shared Woojin's video in the group chat with 'Elani' members. -Hwarin: Listen to this! Listen to it a hundred times! And then she logged into her own SNS. \\"It's too good for me to listen to alone! It's bound to be a hit since it's Mr. Woojin's channel, but still, more people need to hear this song.\\" She shared the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' channel. The morning of the 21st. Around 10 o'clock. Kang Woojin stood in front of an elevator in a tall building. His attire was light due to the warmer weather. However, despite his name bubbling up across Korea and Japan. \\"······\\" Kang Woojin's face was full of an unwavering poker face. Well, this was more genuine than a concept. \\"Ugh- I'm so tired. Did I sleep for about 2 hours? I almost stayed up all night looking at the reactions.\\" Yesterday, Kang Woojin had been glued to his phone until dawn. It was fascinating. His name was everywhere on the internet. Beside him, Choi Seonggeon had been busy taking calls since a while ago. \\"Yes, yes, PD Kim. Hahaha. Thank you. About the casting, well, Woojin's schedule is really tight for the first half of the year. How about the second half?\\" It had been like this since yesterday. From the moment Kang Woojin went 'no holds barred' at the 'Best Guy Friend' production announcement, Choi Seonggeon's phone was bombarded with calls and messages every second. Of course, it was even worse for BW Entertainment. But Kang Woojin had no time to pay attention to Choi Seonggeon. Today was the script reading for star writer Lee Wolseon's 'Freezing Love.' This tall building was where the production company for 'Freezing Love' was located, and the script reading was set to officially start in about an hour. Kang Woojin, who was looking at the elevator floor numbers, let out a small breath. He took a deep breath. \\"I don't know a single person today, huh- I'm a little nervous... I'm starting to feel queasy.\\" Should I take some motion sickness medicine? As Woojin was thinking, Choi Seonggeon, who had just finished his call, spoke up. \\"The calls are coming in like messages. Look, here comes another one. At this rate, I won't be able to enter the reading room. But you'll be fine on your own, right? You're not the type to get nervous.\\" No? I want to take some motion sickness medicine. But Woojin, hiding his true feelings, nodded solemnly. \\"Yes, that's sufficient.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who had been grinning, patted Kang Woojin's shoulder. \\"Well, you're often the first at many things, but there's probably no other actor who attends script readings as frequently as you do. And you're still a rookie.\\" \\"I'm attending because of the writer.\\" \\"Oh? Ah- right, right. Honestly, you don't really need to attend this reading. Your part is short. But it's good to make an impression on writer Lee Wolseon.\\" \\"Yes, I think so too.\\" \\"You never know when connections in this industry will come in handy.\\" Choi Seonggeon predicted the current situation in the reading room. \\"Ugh, but everyone in the reading room, whether they're actors or staff, will be talking about you.\\" \\"It doesn't matter.\\" \\"Of course, when have you ever cared about that?\\" At that moment. -Ding! The arriving elevator opened its doors. Meanwhile, inside the 'Freezing Love' reading room. The reading room, with a D-shaped table set up, was almost ready. A few supporting actors had already arrived, and dozens of staff members were present, as well as a handful of reporters. The funny thing was. \\"Is it certain that Kang Woojin is coming?\\" \\"Ah- Yes, it is. I asked the assistant director several times. If you can't trust it, Kim Reporter, go and ask again.\\" \\"You're lucky. There was a lot of talk about whether Kang Woojin would come to the reading or not, and now we get to see him the day after the scoop.\\" Everyone was talking about Kang Woojin. \\"Did you see the search sites? Seriously, all the entertainment news articles were about Woojin.\\" \\"It makes sense. There's a bit of national pride, but it's the first time in the history of the film industry.\\" \\"But it's really amazing, how did he just gulp down the lead role in that field? Does he have a strong backer?\\" \\"I saw an article that said he might be from a chaebol family. Acting, vocals, Japanese. He must have received intense early education.\\" Reporters, staff, and actors were all busy gossiping. \\"Wow- Kang Woojin. I'm envious, so envious. When will I ever get to go abroad?\\" \\"First, you need to shed your supporting role image in Korea, don't you?\\" \\"You're in the same boat.\\" \\"Anyway, the internet and SNS are all talking about Kang Woojin. This will last a while. I wonder if he'll start ignoring other actors?\\" \\"I heard he's got a good personality.\\" At that moment. -Swish. The glass door slowly opened, and a man with a cold expression on his face entered. It was Kang Woojin. As a result, everyone in the reading room turned their attention to Woojin at the entrance, and he bowed his head slightly and spoke in a low voice. \\"Good afternoon, I'm Kang Woojin.\\" Suddenly, the reading room fell silent. At that moment, a reporter who was a bit dazed looking at Woojin had his phone in sight. It was the 'Kang Woojin Sub-Character' YouTube channel, probably because he was about to meet Kang Woojin. What was interesting was [Channel Name: Kang Woojin Sub-Character] [Subscribers: 509,000] [Videos: 2] The subscriber count had 'skyrocketed.' Around that time, outside the reading room. Choi Seonggeon, who was wandering the hallway, was still on the phone. The calls were pouring in like crazy. His current call was with Kim Sohyang from Netflix Korea. \\"The promotional schedule in Japan is on the 26th?\\" The promotional schedule in Japan referred to the event disguised as a production announcement that she had mentioned before. It was planned in collaboration with Japanese Netflix. Anyway, in response to Choi Seonggeon's question, Kim Sohyang, the general director on the phone, answered. \\"Yes, next month would be fine too, but we've agreed with the Japanese Netflix side that it's best to set these things up as soon as possible. We need to strike while the iron is hot. Of course, if Woojin's schedule doesn't fit, we'll have to change direction.\\" \\"No, next month is even harder. Woojin's schedule next month is twice as busy as now. Hmm- the 26th.\\" It was just a few days away. Soon, Choi Seonggeon, who had been calculating in his head, spoke up. \\"There are a few schedules set for the 26th, but what about Hwarin's side?\\" \\"It's just a one-day schedule, so it's fine. If it's too difficult, you can arrive in Japan separately from Hwarin. You can join up locally.\\" \\"No, it's better to go together if possible. I'll try to match it up.\\" \\"Oh! Thank you, then I'll prepare for the 26th as planned?\\" \\"Yes, general director.\\" After ending the call, Choi Seonggeon opened his diary. It was already packed without any blank spaces. He sighed softly, wrote something on the next page, and thought to himself. 'Arrive in Japan on the 26th. Handle promotional schedule related to 'Best Guy Friend.' Then- I'll have to schedule a meeting with Director Kyotaro on the 27th after 'Ametalk show!' Closing his diary, he muttered to himself. \\"And on the 30th, the official recording of 'Ametalk show!'\\" In short, Kang Woojin's upcoming schedule in Japan was not just for one day, but a total of four days. The 30th was the recording of 'Ametalk show!' and it would be cumbersome to travel back and forth. Having found an answer, Choi Seonggeon made another call. The person on the other end was the production manager of 'The Island of the Missing.' \\"Yes, manager. Sorry for the late contact. I was sorting out the schedule. Yes, yes. For now, I'll give you the exact details after I meet Director Kyotaro in Japan. Yes. But there won't be any issues with the overseas location schedule, and we'll attach the filming schedule as smoothly as possible.\\" After explaining at length, Choi Seonggeon threw in his closing remark. \\"Yes, then I'll see you after I return from Japan. Yes. Ah- I'll call Director Kwon directly about that part. Yes-\\" -Click. Feeling like he had put out the urgent fire, Choi Seonggeon let out a long sigh. \\"Phew, this is busier than when I was with Hyeyeon. Well, she never had overlapping issues like this. It's chaotic, but it's fun.\\" At that moment. -Woowoo, woowoo. The ringtone sounded again. Choi Seonggeon checked the caller and tilted his head slightly. \\"Director Kim Dohee?\\" The caller was Director Kim Dohee of 'The Drug Dealer.' Then, thinking 'She must be calling to congratulate Woojin,' Choi Seonggeon answered the phone. \\"Yes, director. Haha, have you had your meal?\\" \\"No, I have to eat now. But more importantly, Mr. Choi Daepyo.\\" However, what Director Kim Dohee said on the phone was not a congratulation. \\"We're going to have a blind screening of 'The Drug Dealer' next week.\\" \\"······A blind screening?\\" A blind screening was a schedule that took place at the end of the post-production work. It was a screening where only the production team, including the director, and the actors gathered. A viewing of the finished product, so to speak? That meant. \\"Yes. A blind screening. If possible, I'd like Woojin to come with you, please.\\" It meant that the release of 'The Drug Dealer' was just around the corner. < Fireworks (6) > End"},{"prompt":"高中英语写作教学中存在什么问题是项目式学习能解决的？","response":"在高中英语写作教学中，存在一些问题，项目式学习能够解决这些问题，包括： 1. 学生缺乏兴趣和动力：传统的写作教学往往以老师为中心，讲述结构、规则和技巧，缺乏足够的互动和实践，导致学生对写作缺乏兴趣和动力。而通过项目式学习，学生可以选择感兴趣的主题，自主进行研究和探究，并将所学知识应用到写作中，激发学生的兴趣和动力。 2. 缺乏实践机会：传统的写作教学注重的是理论知识的传授，缺乏实际的写作机会和实践环境。而项目式学习提供了更多的实践机会，学生可以通过参与项目，进行实际的调查研究、采访和实地考察等活动，从而提高写作的实践能力。 3. 缺乏综合性思维能力：传统的写作教学往往注重文章结构和语法的教学，忽视了学生的综合性思维能力的培养。而项目式学习要求学生进行跨学科的综合思考和分析，将不同学科的知识和技能融合运用到写作中，培养学生的综合性思维能力。 4. 缺乏合作与交流能力：传统的写作教学通常是孤立地进行，缺乏师生之间和学生之间的互动和交流。而项目式学习注重学生之间的合作与交流，学生可以在团队中共同进行项目的规划、实施和评估，培养学生的合作能力和交流能力。 通过项目式学习，可以更好地解决这些问题，使学生在写作过程中充分发挥主动性和创造性，提高写作能力和综合素质。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

-잘 숨겼는데 워낙 일이 커져서 안 되겠다 싶은 게 아니었을까? -그래도 내가 좋아하는 낯선 이의 기괴한 희생에 한국 배우가 나오는 건 좀 -강우진! 너무너무 좋다! 그의 너튜브에 들어가 봐 다들 팬이 될 거야! -난 오히려 한국 배우가 나와 줘야된다고 봐, 어차피 일본 배우들은 연기가 퇴화되고 있으니까 -나도 너무 좋은데? 불만이면 넷플렉스 한량부터 보고 오던지 -대단하긴 하네…신인인데 어떻게 주연을 쟁취했을까? · · · 뭐가 됐든 이제 모든 팩트가 드러났다. 이러한 상황은 일본으로서도 유일무의했고, 대중들도 처음보는 광경이라 퍽 소란스러워진다. 물론, 일본 쪽 모두가 긍정적이진 않았다. 부정적인 시선도 많았다. 『밝혀진 ‘한국의 신인 배우’, 그러나 영화계 관계자들은 고개 갸웃』 『「강우진」이 누구야? 걱정 심화되는 네티즌들』 그러나 하나만큼은 일맥상통했다. 이 순간 일본의 언론·여론의 시선이 ‘강우진’과 ‘낯선 이의 기괴한 희생’에 집중됐다는 것. 이름값이, 인지도가 쭉쭉 상승했다. 쌓아온 빌드업이 있기에 부스터는 기본 장착이었다. 덩달아 일본 넷플렉스의 한량 역시 자주 언급됐고. 『타노구치 쿄타로 감독의 「강우진」, 알고 보니 넷플렉스의 인기 한국 드라마 조연 배우』 일본 기자들은 이 이슈의 주인공인 강우진 관련, SNS, 너튜브 채널, 필모, 과거 작품들을 자주 다뤘다. 기본 중의 기본이긴 했다. 대중들이 클릭하는 건 최대한 많은 양의 정보가 포함되어야 하니까. 이쯤, 일본 민영 방송국 TBE에선. “PD님!!” ‘아메토크 show!’의 작가들이 신조 PD에게 달려든 참이었다. “우진씨래요!! 우진씨가 맞대요!” “네? 뭐가요?” “아니! 타노구치 쿄타로 감독이 말한 ‘한국의 신인 배우’요! 우진씨가 맞다구요!” “그게 무슨 소리···확실합니까? 추측들만 난무했고 팩트는 없었잖아요.” “방금요! 타노구치 감독이 공식 입장 발표했어요! 주연으로 낙점한 게 우진씨가 맞다고!” 순간, 빼싹 마른 신조 PD의 눈이 디립다 확장됐다. “다, 당장 bw 엔터에 연락 넣어요! 그리고 기획 짠 거 싹 가져오고!” “네넵!” “서둘러요! bw 엔터와 소통해서 우리도 최대한 빨리 기사 돌려야 되니까! 그리고 기획도 반 이상 갈아 치워야 됩니다!” ‘아메토크 show!’ 팀이 발작에 가까울 정도로 바빠진다. 그리고. 『화제인 한국의 신인「강우진」, 넷플렉스에 곧 런칭할 로코물 ‘남사친’의 주연』 마치 기다렸다는 듯, 일본 넷플렉스 측에서 곧 런칭될 ‘남사친’ 소식을 쏘아 올렸다. 더불어. 『「강우진」, 「화린」‘남사친’ 홍보 일정으로 곧 일본 내한 예정』 강우진과 화린의 일본 스케줄까지 흘렸다. -와! 강우진이랑 화린 일본 온다구?!! -진짜야?? 남사친? 이건 로코물인가? 찾아봐야겠어! -어디 공항! 몇 시에! 나도 직접 보고 싶단 말이야! 이 역시 빠르게 번졌다. 이어 다시 한국. 일본보다 핵폭탄이 먼저 터진 한국은, 오후를 지나 밤이 됐음에도 여전히 요동치고 있었다. 각종 포털사이트의 뉴스는 계속해서 바뀌며, 그 기사는 손가락을 타고 쭉쭉 뻗어 나갔다. 요란했다. 올해 들어 제일 과했다. 이쯤 되면 강우진의 주변인들이 모를 리가 없었다. 극성도 이런 극성이 없을 정도였다. 동생인 강현아는 놀라 자빠졌고 우진의 불알친구들은 단독에서 난리부르스였다. 더해서 강우진이 지금껏 스친 모든 인물들 역시 눈알이 디립다 커졌다. 감독, PD, 배우, 스탭들. 머릿수만 따져도 수백명은 가뿐히 넘는 인원들 모두는 각양각색의 리액션을 보였다. “PD님!! 기사 봤어요?! 우리 강토템이 아카리 작가 실사 영화 주연 확정이래!” “봤어 나도! 그 작품도 겁나 잘되겠구만!” “근데 우진씨는 왜 노래까지 잘하는 거예요? 이거 몰랐어? 알았으면 한량에서 OST 하나 주지 그랬어??” “난들 알았겠나!” 송만우 PD와 박은미 작가를 시작으로, 그 모두를 일일이 표현하기 힘들 정도로 흥분한 모양새였다. 결과적으로는 혼돈의 서막이 열렸다. 그래, 서막. 이건 이제 시작일 뿐이었다. 그 사이 좀 점까지 강우진과 함께였던, 지금은 자신의 벤에 타 있는 화린은 귀에 이어폰을 낀 상태였다. 이유야 심플했다. -♬♪ 강우진의 커버곡을 감상하고 있었으니까. 즉, 너튜브 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널을 확인했다. 인사말 영상에서는 실실 웃었고, 커버곡에선 감동을 금치 못한 얼굴로 급변했다. 그녀는 커버곡을 감상한 지 단 1분 만에 한 손으로 입을 틀어막았다. ‘아니! 우진님! 일본어 조금 할 줄 아는 정도라면서요??! 이게? 이게 어딜 봐서?!’ 커버곡 속 우진의 일본어는 잘하는 수준을 훌쩍 뛰어넘었다. 아니, 격이 달랐다. 그냥 눈을 감고 들으면 일본 가수라 생각이 들 정도. 최소 화린에겐 그랬다. 물론, 그녀의 판단은 틀리지 않았다. 그녀 역시 일본어는 수준급이니까. 이미 화린이 포함된 걸그룹 ‘엘라니’는 일본에서 1티어급 인기였고, 지금껏 많은 일본 스케줄을 소화해왔다. 그러니 화린 역시 일본어를 잘하는 것. ‘나는- 배운 거라 여전히 발음에서 조금 어색함이 있는데, 우진님이 하는 일본어는 그냥 현지인이야.’ 순간, 강우진의 과거가 극심하게 궁금해지는 그녀였다. 하지만 그것도 잠시. -♬♪ 화린은 강우진의 음색에 몸을 맡긴다. 정신이 혼미해진다. 심장이 미친 듯이 뛴다. ‘이 얼굴에, 이 목소리에, 이 톤으로······찢었다. 녹아, 진심으로 녹아. 전혀 우리 노래 안 같아. 너무- 좋아. 하루에 열 번. 아니, 백 번 들을래.’ 흥분한 화린의 팔뚝에 소름이 돋았다. 이건 팬심을 넘어 추앙수준이었다. ‘어떻게 매력이 까도까도 끝이 없지? 하- 진짜 덕질하기 잘한 것 같아.’ 이내 화린은 영상의 표시된 ‘좋아요’ 버튼을 연타한 뒤, ‘엘라니’의 멤버들이 모인 단톡방에 접속해 우진의 영상을 공유했다. -화린: 이거 들어봐! 100번 들어봐! 그리곤 자신의 SNS에 접속해서는. ‘이건 나만 듣긴 너무 아까워! 어차피 우진님 채널이니까 대박 나겠지만, 그래도 더 많이 들어야 돼 이 곡은.’ ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널을 뿌렸다. 21일, 아침. 시간은 10시쯤. 강우진은 한 높은 건물의 엘리베이터 앞에 서 있다. 더워진 날씨에 옷차림은 가볍다. 다만, 언제는 안 그랬냐 만은 국내와 일본 전체로 자신의 이름이 부글대고 있음에도. “······” 강우진의 얼굴엔 흔들림 없는 포커페이스가 가득했다. 뭐, 이건 컨셉보단 진심이긴 했다. ‘어우- 개피곤하네. 한 2시간 잤나? 반응 보느라 밤샐뻔했네.’ 어제 강우진은 퇴근과 함께 새벽까지 핸드폰을 붙잡고 있었으니까. 신기할 수밖에. 인터넷 어디를 들어가도 자신의 이름이 가득했으니까. 그런 그의 옆엔 아까부터 연신 전화를 받는 최성건이 바빠 보인다. “예예, 김PD님. 하하하. 감사합니다. 섭외 말이죠? 하- 근데 지금 우진씨 스케줄이요, 진짜 상반기는 어렵습니다. 하반기는 어떠세요?” 비단 지금만이 아닌 어제부터 그랬다. 강우진이 ‘남사친’ 제작발표회서 ‘노빠꾸’한 순간부터, 최성건의 핸드폰은 초마다 전화며 메시지가 쏟아졌다. 물론, bw 엔터 쪽은 더 심했다. 하지만 강우진은 최성건에게 신경 쓸 겨를이 없었다. 오늘은 스타작가 이월선의 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 대본리딩이 있는 날이었으니까. 이 높은 건물은 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 제작사가 있는 곳이며, 약 1시간 뒤엔 대본리딩이 정식으로 시작될 참. 이내 엘리베이터 층수를 바라보는 무심한 우진이 작게 숨을 뱉었다. 심호흡한 것. ‘오늘은 아는 사람이 진짜 1도 없어, 후- 사알짝 긴장되네···울렁거리기 시작했다.’ 멀미약이라도 먹어야 하나? 우진이 생각할 때 적당히 통화를 마친 최성건이 입을 열었다. “전화가 무슨 톡처럼 걸려온다. 이거 봐 또 온다 또 와. 이 지경이라 리딩장 안에는 못 들어가겄다. 뭐, 혼자라도 괜찮지? 네가 긴장 따위 할 일은 없으니까.” 아니요? 멀미약 먹고 싶은데요. 하지만 본심은 꾹꾹 숨긴 우진이 근엄히 끄덕였다. “네, 충분합니다.” 비죽 웃던 최성건이 강우진의 어깨를 두드렸다. “뭐, 대체로 너는 최초인 게 많은데 너처럼 작품 리딩을 자주하는 배우는 또 없을 거다. 것도 신인이.” “이건 작가님 때문에 참석한다고.” “어? 아- 어어. 글지. 솔직히 여기 리딩은 네가 굳이 참석 안 해도 되긴 해. 분량이 짧으니까. 그래도 이월선 작가한테 눈도장은 찍어두는 게 좋아.” “예, 저도 그렇게 생각합니다.” “이 바닥 인맥이라는 게 언제 어떻게 쓰일지 알 수가 없거든.” 답한 최성건이 현재의 리딩장 상황을 예측했다. “어으, 근데 리딩장에 배우나 스탭들이나 죄다 네 얘기 해대고 있을 거다.” “상관없습니다.” “그렇겠지, 뭐 언제는 니가 그런 거 신경이나 썼냐?” 이때. -띵! 도착한 엘리베이터가 문을 열었다. 한편, ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 리딩장 안. ㄷ자형 책상이 깔린 리딩장은 세팅이 얼추 끝난 상태였다. 이미 도착한 조연급 배우도 몇몇 보였고, 수십 스탭들은 물론이며 대여섯 기자도 눈에 띈다. 웃긴 것은. “강우진 오는 거 확실한 거지?” “아- 그렇다니까. 내가 조기 조연출한테 몇 번이나 물었다고. 정 못 믿겠으면 김기자 네가 가서 다시 물어보든지.” “운이 좋았구만. 강우진 리딩에 온다 안 온다 말이 많았는데, 특종 터지고 바로 다음 날 보다니.” 모두의 입에선 강우진의 얘기가 나오고 있다는 것. “검색사이트 봤어요? 진심 연예면 뉴스에 싹- 다 우진씨 기사던데.” “그럴만하지. 적당히 국뽕도 끼었겠다만, 애초 영화계 역사 통틀어서 처음이라잖아.” “근데 진짜 신기하긴 해요, 대체 어떻게 그 판에서 주연을 꿀떡 먹었지? 뒷배가 좋나?” “어떤 기사 보니까 재벌이란 얘기도 있드만. 연기에, 보컬에, 일본어까지. 조기교육 빡세게 받았다고.” 기자들, 스탭들, 배우들은 수군대기 바빴다. “이야- 강우진. 부럽다, 부러워. 나는 언제 해외 진출해보나.” “오빠는 일단 국내서 조연롤 이미지부터 벗어야지?” “너도 마찬가지잖아.” “어쨌든 인터넷이고 SNS고 죄다 강우진 얘기뿐이더라. 꽤 오래가겠어, 이러면 걔가 막 배우들 무시하고 그러지 않을라나?” “인성 괜찮다고 하던데.” 이 순간. -스윽. 유리문이 천천히 열리며 냉기가 담긴 얼굴의 남자가 들어섰다. 강우진이었다. 덕분에 리딩장 모두의 시선이 입구 쪽 우진에게 붙었고, 잠시간 그들을 훑던 우진이 고개 숙이며 낮게 읊조렸다. “안녕하십니까, 강우진입니다.” 일순, 리딩장이 고요해졌다. 이때 우진을 보며 약간 멍때리는 기자의 핸드폰이 눈에 띈다. 보이는 건 너튜브 ‘강우진 부캐’ 채널, 아마 곧 만날 강우진 때문에 보고 있었던 듯. 흥미로운 것은 [채널명: 강우진 부캐] [구독자 50.9만 명] [동영상 2개] 속된말로 ‘개떡상한’ 구독자 수였다. 그쯤, 리딩장의 밖. 복도를 휘적휘적 도는 최성건은 여전히 핸드폰을 귀에 붙이고 있었다. 미친 듯 쏟아지는 전화. 지금의 통화 상대는 넷플렉스 코리아의 김소향이었다. “일본 홍보 일정이 26일이요?” 일본 홍보 일정이란, 일전에 그녀가 말했던 제작발표회를 빙자한 행사를 말하는 것. 일본 넷플렉스와 합작할 예정. 어쨌든 최성건의 되물음에 핸드폰 너머 김소향 총괄디렉터가 답했다. “네, 다음 달도 괜찮긴 한데, 이런 일은 최대한 빨리 잡는 게 좋다고 일본 넷플렉스 측과 의견 좁혔어요. 한창 왁자지껄할 때 들이받아야죠. 물론, 우진씨 스케줄이 맞지 않으면 방향 틀어야겠지만.” “아니요. 다음 달은 더 힘듭니다. 우진씨 스케줄이 다음 달은 지금의 두 배라. 흠- 26일.” 따지면 며칠 뒤 바로였다. 곧, 머리 속으로 계산기를 두드리던 최성건이 입을 열었다. “26일에 잡힌 스케줄이 몇 있긴 한데, 혹시 화린씨 쪽은 어떻답니까?” “어차피 하루 일정이라 괜찮다고 해요. 정 힘드시면 일본 도착은 화린씨랑 따로 하셔도 돼요. 현지에서 쪼인해도 되니까.” “아니요, 가능하면 같이 가는 그림이 예쁘죠. 알겠습니다. 제가 한 번 맞춰 볼게요.” “아! 감사해요, 그럼 저는 저대로 26일에 맞춰서 준비할게요?” “네, 총괄디렉터님.” 그렇게 통화를 마친 최성건이 다이어리를 펼쳤다. 이미 공백없이 빼곡하다. 작게 한숨 쉰 그가 뒷장을 넘겨 뭔가를 적었고. ‘26일 일본 도착. ‘남사친’ 관련 일본 홍보 스케줄 소화. 이러면- 27일에 ‘아메토크 show!’ 하고 쿄타로 감독 미팅을 잡아야겠어.‘ 다이어리를 덮은 그가 혼잣말을 뱉었다. “그리고 30일엔 ‘아메토크 show!’ 정식 녹화.” 한마디로 강우진의 이번 일본 스케줄은 하루가 아닌, 총 4일이 될 예정이었다. 30일이 ‘아메토크 show!’ 촬영인데 왔다 갔다는 번거로우니까. 뭔가 답이 나온 최성건이 이번에는 본인이 전화를 걸었다. 상대방은 ‘실종의 섬’ 제작실장이었다. “예, 실장님. 연락이 늦었습니다. 스케줄을 좀 정리한다고. 예예. 일단, 정확한 건 이번에 일본 가서 쿄타로 감독을 만난 뒤에 말씀드리겠습니다. 예. 그래도 해외로케 스케줄이 쪽날 일은 없을 겁니다, 촬영 일정도 최대한 기스 안 나게 붙일 거고.” 길게 설명하던 최성건이 마무리 멘트를 던진 뒤. “네네, 그럼 일본 다녀와서 뵙는 거로 하겠습니다. 예. 아- 그 부분은 권감독님께 직접 전화하겠습니다. 네-” -뚝. 얼추 급한 불은 껐다 싶은지 최성건이 긴 한숨을 뱉었다. “후우, 이건 뭐 혜연이 때보다 더 바쁘네. 뭐 하긴. 걔는 이렇게 일이 겹친 적도 없으니까. 정신없어도 재밌긴 해.” 그 순간. -우우웅, 우우우웅. 다시금 울리는 벨소리. 곧, 발신자를 확인한 최성건이 약간 고개를 갸웃했다. “김도희 감독?” 상대가 ‘마약상’의 김도희 감독이었으니까. 그러다 ‘우진에게 축하를 전하려나 보네’ 한 최성건이 전화를 받았다. “네, 감독님. 하하 식사는 하셨습니까?” “아니요, 이제 해야죠. 그보다 최대표님.” 그런데 핸드폰 너머 김도희 감독이 뱉은 것은 축하가 아니었다. “다음 주쯤에 ‘마약상’ 블라인드 시사회 열 건데요.” “······블라인드 시사회요?” 블라인드 시사회란, 작품의 후반 작업 끝에 있는 일정이었다. 감독 등의 제작진들 그리고 배우들만이 모여 시사회를 여는 것. 완성품의 감상이랄까? 그 말인즉슨. “네. 블라인드 시사회요. 가능하면 우진씨랑 같이 오셨으면 좋겠네요, 꼭.” ‘마약상’의 개봉이 코 앞이란 소리였다. < 폭죽 (6) > 끝","response":"< Fireworks (6) > 10 minutes. After the official statement from Director Kyotaro's side was released, it took that much time for similar or nearly identical articles to spread across Japan. \\"Director Kyotaro Tanoguchi officially announces that the Korean actor is 'Kang Woojin', a real newcomer.\\" It was already a hot issue. The controversy had grown even larger due to Director Kyotaro's interview, and it was a matter of great interest to many people. \\"Toega Film Company confirms that the cast Korean actor 'Kang Woojin' is correct.\\" Therefore, the Japanese media copied and pasted the official statement faster than light. Finally, a clear answer had emerged. \\"Kang Woojin is the first newcomer to play a leading role in a foreign film across Korea and Japan!\\" With their curiosity neatly resolved, the Japanese public was perhaps ecstatic, or conversely, some grumbled. -It's really Kang Woojin! I like it! This actor is good at acting. -It was already more or less confirmed in Korea, so why did they hide it?? -They hid it well, but maybe they thought it wouldn't work because the issue became too big? -Still, I like that a Korean actor is in 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger.' -Kang Woojin! I really like him! Go check out his YouTube, everyone will become a fan! -I think it's better to have a Korean actor, since Japanese actors' acting is devolving anyway. -I like it too, if you have complaints, go watch Netflix first. -It's amazing... How did a newcomer secure the lead role? · · · Whatever the case, now all the facts had been revealed. This situation was unprecedented for Japan, and the public was witnessing a scene they had never seen before, causing quite a stir. Of course, not everyone in Japan was positive. There were many negative views as well. \\"The 'newcomer Korean actor' has been revealed, but film industry insiders are tilting their heads.\\" \\"Who is 'Kang Woojin'? Netizens' concerns deepen.\\" However, one thing was consistent. At this moment, the focus of Japan's media and public opinion was concentrated on 'Kang Woojin' and 'The Strange Sacrifice of a Stranger.' His name value, his recognition, soared. There was a buildup, so a booster was naturally attached. Japan's Netflix series 'Hanryang' was also frequently mentioned. \\"Director Kyotaro Tanoguchi's 'Kang Woojin', turns out to be a supporting actor in a popular Korean drama on Netflix.\\" Japanese reporters often covered Kang Woojin-related SNS, YouTube channels, filmographies, and past works. It was basic. The public clicks on articles that contain as much information as possible. Around this time, at the private broadcasting station TBE in Japan. \\"PD-nim!!\\" Writers from the 'Ametalk show!' rushed to Producer Shinjo. \\"It's Woojin-ssi!! It's really Woojin-ssi!\\" \\"What? What are you talking about?\\" \\"No! The 'newcomer Korean actor' that Director Tanoguchi Kyotaro mentioned! It's Woojin-ssi!\\" \\"Are you sure about that? There were only speculations, no facts.\\" \\"Just now! Director Tanoguchi officially announced it! Woojin-ssi is confirmed for the lead role!\\" Producer Shinjo's eyes, which had been dry, suddenly dilated. \\"Quickly, contact BW Entertainment! And bring all the plans we've made!\\" \\"Yes, sir!\\" \\"Hurry up! We need to communicate with BW Entertainment and get our articles out as soon as possible! And we have to overhaul more than half of our plans!\\" The 'Ametalk show!' team became extremely busy, almost to the point of a seizure. And then. \\"The hot topic Korean newcomer 'Kang Woojin', the lead in the rom-com 'Nam Saching' soon to launch on Netflix.\\" As if they had been waiting, the Japanese Netflix side released news about the soon-to-launch 'Nam Saching.' Additionally. \\"'Kang Woojin' and 'Hwarin' are scheduled to visit Japan soon for 'Nam Saching' promotions.\\" The schedule for Kang Woojin and Hwarin in Japan was also leaked. -Wow! Kang Woojin and Hwarin are coming to Japan?!! -Really?? Nam Saching? Is this a rom-com? I need to look it up! -Which airport! What time! I want to see them in person too! This news spread quickly as well. Then back to Korea. Korea, where the nuclear bomb had exploded first, was still in turmoil even as the afternoon turned to night. News on various portal sites kept changing, and the articles spread far and wide at the touch of a finger. It was noisy. The most excessive of the year. By now, it was impossible for those around Kang Woojin not to know. His sister, Kang Hyuna, was shocked, and Woojin's close friends were in a frenzy. Moreover, everyone Kang Woojin had ever encountered was also shocked. Directors, PDs, actors, staff. Counting just the number of people, hundreds were showing a variety of reactions. \\"PD-nim!! Did you see the article?! Our Kang Totem is confirmed for the lead role in Akari writer's live-action movie!\\" \\"I saw it too! That project will do really well!\\" \\"But why is Woojin-ssi so good at singing? Did you not know this? If I had known, I would have given him an OST for Hanryang??\\" \\"How would I have known!\\" Starting with PD Song Manwoo and writer Park Eunmi, everyone was too excited to express individually. As a result, the prelude to chaos had begun. Yes, the prelude. This was just the beginning. In the meantime, Hwarin, who had been with Kang Woojin until recently and was now sitting in her van, had earphones in her ears. The reason was simple. -♬♪ She was listening to Kang Woojin's cover song. That is, she had checked out the YouTube 'Kang Woojin sub-character' channel. She giggled at the greeting video, and her face changed to one of deep emotion as she listened to the cover song. She covered her mouth with one hand just a minute after listening to the cover song. \\"No! Woojin-nim! You said you could speak a little Japanese??! This? This is not just a little?!\\" Kang Woojin's Japanese in the cover song was far beyond just being good. No, it was on a different level. If you just closed your eyes and listened, you would think it was a Japanese singer. At least, that's how Hwarin felt. Of course, her judgment was not wrong. She was also proficient in Japanese. The girl group 'Elani', which included Hwarin, was already popular in Japan, and she had been handling many Japanese schedules until now. So Hwarin was also good at Japanese. 'I learned it, so there's still a bit of awkwardness in my pronunciation, but Woojin-nim's Japanese is just like a native.' Suddenly, Hwarin became extremely curious about Kang Woojin's past. But that was only for a moment. -♬♪ Hwarin let herself be carried away by Kang Woojin's voice. Her mind became dizzy. Her heart raced wildly. 'With this face, this voice, this tone... it's torn apart. I'm melting, truly melting. It doesn't even sound like our song. It's too good. I want to listen to it ten times a day. No, a hundred times.' Excited, Hwarin's arms got goosebumps. This was beyond fandom; it was adoration. 'How can someone have endless charm? Ah- I really think I did well becoming a fan.' Then Hwarin repeatedly tapped the 'like' button on the video and shared Woojin's video in the group chat with 'Elani' members. -Hwarin: Listen to this! Listen to it 100 times! Then she logged into her SNS. 'It's too good for me to listen to alone! Anyway, Woojin-nim's channel will be a hit, but still, more people need to hear this song.' She shared the 'Kang Woojin sub-character' channel. The morning of the 21st. Around 10 o'clock. Kang Woojin stood in front of an elevator in a tall building. The weather had warmed up, so his clothes were light. However, despite his name being buzzed about in Korea and Japan. \\"......\\" Kang Woojin's face was full of a poker face. Well, this was more sincere than a concept. 'Ugh- so tired. Did I sleep for about 2 hours? I almost stayed up all night looking at the reactions.' Yesterday, Kang Woojin had been holding onto his phone until dawn. It was fascinating. His name was everywhere on the internet. Beside him, Choi Seonggeon had been busy taking calls since a while ago. \\"Yes, yes, Kim PD-nim. Hahaha. Thank you. About the casting, well, Woojin-ssi's schedule is really tight for the first half of the year. How about the second half?\\" Not just now, but since yesterday, Choi Seonggeon's phone had been ringing non-stop with calls and messages since the moment Kang Woojin went 'no back down' at the 'Nam Saching' press conference. Of course, it was even worse for BW Entertainment. However, Kang Woojin had no time to pay attention to Choi Seonggeon. Today was the day for the script reading of 'Freezing Love' by star writer Lee Wolseon. This tall building was where the production company for 'Freezing Love' was located, and in about an hour, the script reading would officially begin. Kang Woojin, who had been looking at the elevator floor numbers indifferently, let out a small breath. He took a deep breath. 'Today, I don't know a single person, huh- I'm a little nervous... I'm starting to feel queasy.' Should I take some motion sickness medicine? Just as Woojin was thinking, Choi Seonggeon, who had just finished his call, spoke up. \\"The calls are coming in like messages. Look, here comes another one. It's like this, so I probably won't be able to enter the reading room. But you'll be fine on your own, right? You don't get nervous.\\" No? I want to take motion sickness medicine. But Woojin, hiding his true feelings, nodded solemnly. \\"Yes, that's enough.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who had been smirking, patted Kang Woojin's shoulder. \\"Well, you're often the first in many things, but there probably isn't another actor who attends script readings as often as you do. And you're still a newcomer.\\" \\"I'm attending because of the writer-nim.\\" \\"Oh? Ah- right. Honestly, you don't really need to attend this reading. Your part is short. But it's good to make an impression on writer Lee Wolseon.\\" \\"Yes, I think so too.\\" \\"You never know when connections in this industry will come in handy.\\" Choi Seonggeon, who had responded, predicted the current situation in the reading room. \\"Ugh, but everyone in the reading room, whether they're actors or staff, will be talking about you.\\" \\"It doesn't matter.\\" \\"Of course, when have you ever cared about that?\\" At that moment. -Ding! The arriving elevator opened its doors. Meanwhile, inside the reading room for 'Freezing Love'. The reading room, with a 'D'-shaped table set up, was almost ready. A few supporting actors had already arrived, and dozens of staff members, as well as about half a dozen reporters, were visible. The funny thing was. \\"Is it certain that Kang Woojin is coming?\\" \\"Yeah- I told you. I asked the assistant director several times. If you really can't believe it, Kim reporter, go and ask again.\\" \\"Lucky you. There was a lot of talk about whether Kang Woojin would come to the reading or not, and to see him the day after the scoop broke.\\" Everyone was talking about Kang Woojin. \\"Did you see the search sites? Seriously, all the entertainment news articles were about Woojin-ssi.\\" \\"That's understandable. It's not just national pride, but it's the first time in the history of the film industry.\\" \\"But it's really amazing, how did he snag the lead role in that field? Does he have a strong backer?\\" \\"Some articles say he's a chaebol. Acting, vocals, Japanese. He must have received intense early education.\\" Reporters, staff, and actors were all busy gossiping. \\"Wow- Kang Woojin. I'm jealous, so jealous. When will I ever get to go abroad?\\" \\"First, you need to get rid of your supporting role image in Korea, don't you?\\" \\"You're in the same boat.\\" \\"Anyway, the internet and SNS are all talking about Kang Woojin. This will last a while. I wonder if he'll start ignoring other actors?\\" \\"I heard he's got a good personality.\\" At this moment. -Swish. The glass door slowly opened, and a man with a cold face entered. It was Kang Woojin. As a result, everyone in the reading room turned their gaze to Woojin at the entrance, and after scanning them briefly, Woojin bowed his head and murmured softly. \\"Hello, I'm Kang Woojin.\\" For a moment, the reading room fell silent. At that time, a reporter who was staring blankly at Woojin noticed a phone. It was showing the YouTube 'Kang Woojin sub-character' channel, probably because he was about to meet Kang Woojin. What was interesting was [Channel Name: Kang Woojin Sub-Character] [Subscribers: 509,000] [Videos: 2] The subscriber count had 'exploded'. Around that time, outside the reading room. Choi Seonggeon, who had been wandering the hallway, still had his phone to his ear. The calls were pouring in like crazy. He was currently on the phone with Kim Sohyang from Netflix Korea. \\"The promotional schedule in Japan is on the 26th?\\" The promotional schedule in Japan referred to the event disguised as a press conference that she had mentioned before. It was planned in collaboration with Japanese Netflix. Anyway, Choi Seonggeon's question was answered by Kim Sohyang, the director on the other end of the phone. \\"Yes, next month is fine too, but for such events, it's better to set them up as soon as possible. We've narrowed down our opinions with the Japanese Netflix side. We have to strike while the iron is hot. Of course, if Woojin-ssi's schedule doesn't match, we'll have to change direction.\\" \\"No, next month will be even harder. Woojin-ssi's schedule for next month is twice as busy as now. Hmm- the 26th.\\" It was just a few days away. Soon, after tapping on his mental calculator, Choi Seonggeon spoke up. \\"There are a few schedules set for the 26th, but what about Hwarin-ssi's side?\\" \\"It's just a one-day event, so she said it's fine. If it's difficult for you, you can arrive in Japan separately from Hwarin-ssi. You can join on-site.\\" \\"No, it's better to go together if possible. I'll try to match it up.\\" \\"Oh! Thank you, then shall I prepare for the 26th as planned?\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" After ending the call, Choi Seonggeon opened his diary. It was already packed without any gaps. He sighed softly and wrote something on the next page. 'Arrive in Japan on the 26th. Digest the promotional schedule for 'Nam Saching' in Japan. Then- I should schedule a meeting with Director Kyotaro on the 27th.' Closing his diary, he muttered to himself. \\"And on the 30th, the official recording of 'Ametalk show!'\\" In other words, Kang Woojin's upcoming schedule in Japan was not just for one day, but a total of four days. The 30th was the recording of 'Ametalk show!', and it would be cumbersome to go back and forth. Having found an answer, Choi Seonggeon now made a call. The person on the other end was the production manager of 'The Island of the Missing.' \\"Yes, Manager. I'm sorry for the late contact. I was sorting out the schedule. Yes, yes. For now, I'll tell you the exact details after I meet Director Kyotaro in Japan. Yes. But there shouldn't be any issues with the overseas location schedule, and we'll try to fit the filming schedule as smoothly as possible.\\" After explaining at length, Choi Seonggeon threw in a closing remark. \\"Yes, then I'll see you after I return from Japan. Yes. Ah- I'll call Director Kwon directly about that part. Yes-\\" -Click. Feeling like he had put out the urgent fire, Choi Seonggeon let out a long sigh. \\"Phew, this is busier than when I was with Hyeyeon. Well, she never had overlapping work like this. It's chaotic but fun.\\" At that moment. -Woowoo, woowoo. The ringtone sounded again. Choi Seonggeon, who checked the caller, tilted his head slightly. \\"Director Kim Dohee?\\" The caller was Director Kim Dohee of 'Drug Dealer'. Then, thinking 'maybe he's calling to congratulate Woojin', Choi Seonggeon answered the phone. \\"Yes, Director. Haha, have you had a meal?\\" \\"No, I have to eat now. But more importantly, Manager Choi.\\" However, what Director Kim Dohee said on the other end of the phone was not a congratulation. \\"We're going to have a blind screening of 'Drug Dealer' next week.\\" \\"......A blind screening?\\" A blind screening was a schedule that took place at the end of the post-production work of a project. It was a screening where only the production team, including the director, and the actors gathered. It was a viewing of the finished product. That meant. \\"Yes. A blind screening. If possible, I'd like you and Woojin-ssi to come together, please.\\" The release of 'Drug Dealer' was just around the corner. < Fireworks (6) > End"},{"prompt":"Найдите в предложениях ошибки, связанные с нарушением лексической сочетаемости, исправьте предложения. .

The objective is to cluster words that represent similar concepts or objects into categories that are easily recognizable. Here is the reasoning behind each of the groups formed: **Transportation Vehicles:** All these items are modes of transportation used to carry people or goods from one place to another. **Traffic and Roadside Items:** These objects are commonly found on or near roads and are associated with traffic control or road services. **Street Furniture:** These are items that are typically installed outdoors for public use, though \\"bench\\" was the only one listed. **Animals:** This is straightforward. All the listed items in this group are living creatures from various species. **Personal Items:** These are items typically owned and used by individuals for personal use, assisting with day-to-day activities or needs. **Sports and Recreation Equipment:** These objects are associated with recreational activities, sports, and hobbies. **Dining and Kitchen Utensils:** Items in this category are used for eating, drinking, or preparing food. **Food Items:** All the items here are edible and are types of food. **Furniture and Home Appliances:** These are items typically found in homes and are used for sitting, sleeping, entertainment, or performing functions related to household chores. **Personal Care Items:** This group includes items related to grooming and personal hygiene. **Materials and Natural Elements:** These items are materials found in nature or used in various contexts, such as building materials or natural elements like clouds, water, etc. Some items in this list are somewhat broader and could potentially be divided further, but they have been grouped due to their material nature or relation to the natural environment. **Infrastructure:** These words refer to large-scale public systems, structures, and facilities essential for the economic development and functioning of a country's inhabitants. Categorization can sometimes be subjective and context-dependent. Certain words could belong to multiple categories based on their use in different contexts. The rationale behind the groups was to find the most prominent characteristic shared by words within each group, even if this means some words are placed differently than expected."},{"prompt":"Please merge the groups with only one item with other groups please","response":"Sure, we can merge the smaller categories with the most relevant larger categories. For example: **Street Furniture and Traffic Items:** - Bench - Traffic_light - Fire_hydrant - Stop_sign - Parking_meter Now, the categories with multiple items look like this: **Transportation Vehicles and Related Items:** - Bicycle - Car - Motorcycle - Airplane - Bus - Train - Truck - Boat **Street Furniture and Traffic Items:** - Bench - Traffic_light - Fire_hydrant - Stop_sign - Parking_meter **Animals:** - Bird - Cat - Dog - Horse - Cow - Elephant - Bear - Giraffe **Personal Items and Sports Equipment:** - Backpack - Umbrella - Handbag - Bottle - Cell_phone - Frisbee - Skis - Snowboard - Sports_ball - Kite - Baseball_bat - Skateboard - Surfboard - Tennis_racket **Dining, Kitchen Utensils, and Food Items:** - Wine_glass - Cup - Fork - Knife - Spoon - Bowl - Microwave - Oven - Toaster - Sink - Refrigerator - Banana - Apple - Sandwich - Orange - Carrot - Hot_dog - Pizza - Donut - Cake **Furniture, Home Appliances, and Personal Care Items:** - Chair - Couch - Potted_plant - Bed - Dining_table - Toilet - Tv - Laptop - Mouse - Remote - Keyboard - Book - Clock - Scissors - Teddy_bear - Hair_drier - Toothbrush **Materials, Natural Elements, and Infrastructure:** - Banner - Blanket - Branch - Bridge - Building-other - Bush - Cardboard - Carpet - Ceiling-other - Ceiling-tile - Cloth - Clouds - Counter - Cupboard - Curtain - Desk-stuff - Dirt - Door-stuff - Cabinet - Fence - Floor-marble - Floor-other - Floor-stone - Floor-tile - Floor-wood - Flower - Fog - Food-other - Fruit - Grass - Gravel - Ground-other - Hill - House - Leaves - Light - Mat - Metal - Mirror-stuff - Moss - Mountain - Mud - Napkin - Net - Paper - Pavement - Pillow - Plant-other - Plastic - Playingfield - Railing - Road - Rock - Roof - Rug - Salad - Sand - Sea - Shelf - Sky-other - Skyscraper - Snow - Solid-other - Stairs - Stone - Straw - Structural-other - Table - Tent - Textile-other - Tree - Vegetable - Wall-concrete - Wall-other - Wall-panel - Wall-stone - Wall-tile - Wall-wood - Water-other - Waterdrops - Window-blind - Window-other - Wood These revised groups take into consideration both the number of items and their relatedness in meaning and application.

Dans votre code où vous définissez la classe \`Evenement\`, vous avez une méthode \`timedelta_to_time\` qui convertit un objet \`timedelta\` en un objet \`time\`. Mais, quand vous initialisez les instances \`evenement1\` et \`evenement2\`, vous passez directement des chaînes de caractères représentant les heures (comme \\"10:00\\") à la place d'objets \`timedelta\`. Pour résoudre le problème, vous devez vous assurer que les attributs \`heureDebutE\` et \`heureFinE\` de vos objets \`Evenement\` sont bien des instances de datetime.time. Cela peut être fait en ajustant la méthode \`__init__\` de la classe \`Evenement\` pour qu'elle prenne correctement en charge les chaînes de caractères et les convertisse en objets \`time\`.

Из за того что они имеют статусы знаменитости, или что?","response":"В Соединенных Штатах Америки налоговый кодекс не делает различий между гражданами основываясь на их статусе знаменитости. Объем налогов, которые индивидуум должен уплатить, зависит от высоты его или ее дохода, а не от того, насколько известен человек. Голливудские знаменитости часто имеют относительно высокий доход благодаря заработкам от их работ в кино- и телеиндустрии, а также от вторичных источников дохода, таких как рекламные сделки, лицензирование и личные бизнесы. В соответствии с прогрессивной налоговой системой США, чем выше доход, тем выше процентная ставка, которую обязан заплатить налогоплательщик. Это означает, что знаменитости с высокими доходами могут столкнуться с более высокими налоговыми ставками по сравнению с среднестатистическими гражданами. Все физические лица, включая знаменитостей, обязаны уплачивать федеральные налоги, а также могут обязаны уплачивать штатные и местные налоги в зависимости от места жительства и места получения дохода. В некоторых штатах, как Калифорния, где много знаменитостей проживают и работают, налоговые ставки являются одними из самых высоких в стране. Помимо этого, знаменитости часто используют услуги профессиональных бухгалтеров и налоговых консультантов, чтобы оптимизировать свои налоговые обязательства и воспользоваться всеми возможными налоговыми льготами и вычетами. Вкратце, голливудские знаменитости платят большие налоги потому, что они зарабатывают большие деньги, а налоговая система США устроена таким образом, что люди с более высокими доходами платят более высокие налоги."},{"prompt":"Поэтому некоторые знаменитости избегают, но получают за это арест","response":"Да, иногда некоторые знаменитости могут попытаться избежать уплаты налогов, что может привести к серьезным юридическим последствиям, включая штрафы, взыскания и даже арест. Налоговое уклонение является преступлением в США, и Индивидуальная служба внутренних доходов (IRS) строго преследует уклонение от уплаты налогов. Знаменитости не являются исключением из правил, и закон применяется ко всем без исключения. Имея более сложные финансовые дела, знаменитости иногда используют сложные схемы налогового планирования, которые могут привести к спорам с IRS относительно их законности. Хотя некоторые из этих мер являются законными и принимаются налоговыми системами для уменьшения налоговой нагрузки (например, инвестиции в благотворительные фонды или использование законных налоговых вычетов), проколы в системе и умышленное уклонение от уплаты налогов могут привести к уголовной ответственности. Известные случаи, когда знаменитости сталкивались с налоговыми проблемами, включают Уэсли Снайпса и Лорин Хилл, которые оба провели время в тюрьме за уклонение от уплаты налогов. Эти примеры служат предостережением для других о том, что независимо от статуса или богатства, любой, кто уклоняется от уплаты налогов, может быть обвинен и наказан."},{"prompt":"По-моему это несправедливо, когда налог зависит от уровней доходностей, это не дает человеку стать богатым","response":"Ваше замечание отражает распространенное мнение некоторых людей, которые считают, что прогрессивная налоговая система, где ставки налогов возрастают с увеличением дохода, может действовать как демотиватор к зарабатыванию больших денег. Однако, прогрессивная налоговая система основана на принципе способности платить. Она исходит из идеи, что богатые люди могут и должны вносить больший вклад в общественное благосостояние, так как они больше всего выигрывают от инфраструктуры и услуг, предоставляемых государством, и с большей долей дохода могут сохранять высокий уровень жизни, даже после уплаты более высоких налогов. Некоторые ключевые аргументы в пользу прогрессивного налогообложения: 1. **Способность к платежу**: Считается, что люди с более высокими доходами могут позволить себе платить больше налогов с меньшим ущербом для своего уровня жизни по сравнению с людьми с низким или средним доходом. 2. **Перераспределение богатства**: Прогрессивное налогообложение помогает сокращать экономическое неравенство, распределяя доход от богатых к более низким доходным слоям через государственные программы и услуги. 3. **Фискальная политика**: Правительствам необходимы доходы для финансирования публичных товаров и услуг, таких как образование, инфраструктура, оборона и социальное обеспечение. Высокий доход гарантирует, что правительство может выполнять эти функции, поддерживая стабильное и функционирующее общество. 4. **Экономические стимулы**: Заставляя более богатых платить больше, обеспечивается, что эти средства могут быть использованы для инвестиций в экономику, потенциально создавая рабочие места и стимулируя экономический рост. Тем не менее, существует и противоположная точка зрения, которая утверждает, что более высокие налоги для богатых могут подавлять инвестиции, предпринимательство и экономическое развитие. Критики могут считать, что прогрессивная система налогообложения может снижать стимулы для заработка больших денег, поскольку значительная часть дополнительного дохода будет отчисляться в виде налогов. Вопросы налогообложения и их справедливости являются предметом широких политических и экономических дебатов. Для налоговой политики важно найти баланс между обеспечением достаточных доходов государства для финансирования общественных услуг и сохранением стимулов для экономического роста и личного благосостояния."},{"prompt":"Налоги в размере два миллиона долларов с американского актера, это же вообще ужас","response":"Высокие суммы налогов для индивидуумов с высокими доходами могут казаться огромными, но важно помнить, что в прогрессивной налоговой системе, как в США, налоги устанавливаются в процентном соотношении от дохода человека. Если американский актер платит налоги в размере двух миллионов долларов, это означает, что его доход был значительно большим. К примеру, в США, для года 2021 для самых высоких доходностей установлена максимальная федеральная налоговая ставка в 37% для доходов свыше 523,600 для одиночек или 628,300 для супружеских пар, подающих совместную налоговую декларацию. Это не включает налоги штата и местные налоги, которые могут быть существенными, особенно в штатах с высокими налоговыми ставками, таких как Калифорния или Нью-Йорк. Таким образом, если актер платит 2 миллиона в виде налогов, его общий доход должен был быть намного больше этой суммы. Следовательно, даже после уплаты такого налога, его чистый доход остается очень высоким, вероятно, достигая миллионов долларов. Хотя сумма в 2 миллиона может выглядеть как большая жертва, важно помнить, что те, кто находится в верхних категориях заработка, все еще сохраняют значительную часть своего дохода после уплаты налогов и часто имеют доступ к более качественным услугам и возможностям. Также, как уже было отмечено, более высокие налоги с более богатых людей идут на финансирование государственных услуг и поддержку социальных программ, что, по мнению многих, является справедливым и обязательным вкладом в общественное благосостояние."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This peculiar event unfolded shortly after Napoleon had signed the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, a significant moment that marked the end of hostilities between the French Empire and Imperial Russia . The Hunt Organized by Berthier To celebrate the peace achievement, Napoleon's chief of staff, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, was tasked with organizing a grand rabbit hunt. Berthier, who also served as the minister of war, chose his own land outside Paris for the event and ordered a large number of rabbits from local farms to be delivered for the hunt . The number of rabbits gathered for this occasion was staggering, with accounts suggesting anywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 of these creatures were caged along the fringes of a field, ready to be released upon Napoleon's command . The Unexpected Turn of Events As the hunt commenced, the rabbits did not react as anticipated. Instead of fleeing in terror, they charged towards Napoleon and his men in an aggressive and unrelenting swarm . The scene quickly descended into chaos as the rabbits flanked the hunters, some even managing to leap into the imperial coach, directly threatening the emperor himself . Napoleon, the conqueror of Europe, found himself absurdly outnumbered and was forced to make a hasty retreat, leaving the field in the possession of the rabbits . The Mistake of Tame Rabbits The root of this fiasco lay in a critical oversight by Berthier. Instead of procuring wild hares, which would have naturally fled from humans, he had sourced tame rabbits from nearby farms . These domesticated rabbits, accustomed to being fed by people, mistook Napoleon and his hunting party for their caretakers and expected to be fed rather than hunted . This misunderstanding led to the unexpected and comical assault on the French emperor and his men. Conclusion The rabbit hunt of 1807 stands as a humorous anecdote in the annals of history, showcasing that even the mightiest of leaders can find themselves at the mercy of the most unlikely adversaries. Napoleon, who had faced and defeated numerous human armies, met his match in a legion of fearless farm rabbits, resulting in what some might call his most humiliating defeat . This event serves as a reminder that sometimes, the smallest and most unexpected of foes can disrupt the best-laid plans of emperors and generals alike.\\" if you understood say \\"OK\\"","response":"OK Here is an outline for your educational yet humorous animation about Napoleon's Failed Rabbit Hunt: **Title: \\"Napoleon and the Battle of Bunnies\\"** **Opening Scene:** 1.

Berthier marches in enthusiastically, saluting grandiosely, almost swatting a candle off the desk with his spirited gestures. **Napoleon:** Berthier, approach. The scent of victory at Tilsit still lingers, but I'm bored of outfoxing emperors. It's time we hunted something more... tangible. **Berthier:** (snaps to attention) Of course, Your Imperial Highness! Shall we prepare a hunt? You versus the fiercest of beasts? Napoleon gives Berthier a skeptical look. **Napoleon:** No, Berthier, nothing that could potentially eat you. We shall hunt rabbits, a regal sport of kings! **Berthier:** (with a goofy grin) Rabbits, Sire, profound choice! Bouncy, fluffy, utterly... terrifying?

Убедитесь, что переменная \`offsetCrystalls\` правильно передается и используется для начисления кристаллов. Проверьте, что значение \`offsetCrystalls\` не равно нулю и что оно корректно добавляется к балансу кристаллов пользователя. 3. Проверьте, обновляется ли база данных после начисления кристаллов. Убедитесь, что метод \`database.update()\` вызывается после обновления баланса кристаллов.

Here are the results.** *Before I begin; I made a similar post four months ago covering the results up to that point. However, I feel like I did not go into sufficient depth. Additionally, I would like to discuss future plans.* **Introduction** My first game is titled 'Open The Gates!'. It is a 2D sidescroller castlebuilder RTS game inspired by games such as Stronghold. It targets people who casually like strategy games. An ideal player is someone who wants to jump in, build a castle and fight off enemy attacks without having to learn complex mechanics or struggle to 'get good'. My game is relatively simple and the tutorial is setup in a way such that the player figures out everything on their own. In case something is unclear to the player, a voice-acted character will help the player out. *If you want to check out the game for yourself, here is a link!* [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332450/Open_The_Gates/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332450/Open_The_Gates/) **Game** My game is a castlebuilder with a relatively cheerful art-style. I worked together with an artist I found online and she turned out to be literally amazing and I am still working with her today on my next project. We worked out an arrangement where I would pay a reduced rate per asset in exchange for a 20% revenue share. This arrangement has a few pros and cons. A giant positive is that the artist is genuinely interested in the game and treats it more like their own project in a way. This turns the freelancing artist into more of a teammember, which I way prefer. One obvious negative is that you lose out on a significant chunk of revenue and you set a precedent in case you want to continue working with the same person. For example, on my next project I am still giving 20% of the revenue to the artist. **Initial Design** My **initial budget** for the game was a modest **350,- USD.** When I was 16 years old (I am now 22) I first came up with the idea for the game. I threw together a [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVjX7DlcCBu0tmAzdFN4G5qIFGIRo6NYjzcpUvfMXKE/edit?usp=sharing), which is terribly written but a fun read all these years later. As I turned 18 I revisited the idea and decided to resume work on it. **Development** I started by worked with another artist who volunteered to create a few assets for the game. However, we later parted ways. I still credit this person as 'Concept Artist' though. A year went by and nothing happened until I decided to start actually getting serious about the game. I started full development on the game in February of 2020 (shortly before pandemic). The game was released after two and a half years on October 17th 2022. Surprisingly, the development was relatively smooth. The art and the music were done after a year but due to my inexperience the coding parts took longer than expected. The unit movement code was rewritten a grand total of seven times, for example. In total I invested 2000 euros into the development of this game. The money mostly went to paying for art assets and paying for a musician to do music. For music, I was contacted by a musician who had little experience making game soundtracks and who wanted to do the music for the game for a reduced rate. I ended up paying 40USD per minute of music which I thought was very reasonable. He turned out to be quite talented and went on to make a lot more quality soundtracks. There are many voice acted characters in the game. The voices were all done by volunteer actors and actresses who reached out to me. I find adding voice acted characters to a game makes the game feel a lot more alive. **Marketing up to release** I had absolutely no idea how to market a game. I posted on X (formerly Twitter) occasionally, but no posts really got any traction. I gained about 1-3 wishlists a day simply from Steam traffic. The page launched early 2020 so it had a massive amount of time to simply accumulate wishlists. However, the most important pre-launch marketing moment was the Steam Next Fest of June 2022. I released a demo without reaching out to any streamers or youtubers. This probably was not smart but I did not realize the importance of Steam Next Fest at that time. Thankfully I got extremely lucky since my demo got picked up by some massive youtubers such as [SplatterCatGaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQ8BKe76K0) and [BaronVonGames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KFJcNq0Oo). This resulted in a [massive spike](https://imgur.com/31TXkLK) in wishlists. In total I [gained 2882 wishlists](https://imgur.com/wfbBjCU) in three months time. This was fun! The daily wishlist count dropped back down after July and only started ramping up as videos started coming out before release. **Before release** Having seen how succesful the youtube videos / streamers were for the demo, I decided to send a whole bunch of emails (with pre-release keys) to a variety of streamers / youtubers. A lot of them had already covered the demo so it was easier to convince them to also cover the full game. In total I sent around 200 emails by hand, personalizing each email. This took a few days of grinding but I feel like it was worth it. Here is the [presskit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19kwsmi34_oLUo6-p_n-CHAoJm5CCMbmB?usp=sharing) I sent along with the mail. There were a lot of videos covering the game such as [SplatterCatGaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHRBcRgmmvA), [BaronVonGames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU75CxfGy5w) and [Real Civil Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bn4cJxCQfE). These videos got a lot of views. In total, I launched my game with [4702 wishlists](https://imgur.com/ewXJ6RB). This was **not** sufficient for the popular upcoming. The fact I didn't make this list likely harmed my sales significantly. In the future I will not launch a game with less than 7000 wishlists. **Sales** [Click here for the full financial overview up to today.](https://imgur.com/mwPauXH) In short; Gross Revenue: 27.601 USD. Net Revenue: 21.960 USD However, as discussed earlier, the artist got 20%. Additionally, there was a 9 euro transfer fee with the bank and I had to pay some taxes. The total amount I earned all things considered is: **€11.222 EUR.** My [wishlist conversion rate](https://imgur.com/mXilqBD) is 11% which is below average according to Steam. Interestingly, the game is still selling to this day. Each month has been 100+ EUR net for me and there is no real sign this is slowing down. I am unsure how long this will last, anyone have any ideas? **Reviews** I quickly reached 10 reviews on Steam, kickstarting the discovery queue traffic. The reviews were generally positive, although there is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRgcpkFieds) which completely destroyed my game. It is a fun watch and I respect his opinion, he makes valid points and I hold no grudges. The game currently sits at 49 reviews and is classified as 'Mostly Positive'. The frustrating thing is that this would change to 'Very Positive' if I got just one more positive review... Oh well! That's the way of the world! **Conclusion** The game was mildly succesful for a first project. It could have done better had I somehow pulled about 2000 wishlists out of thin air before launch so it could have gotten into the popular upcoming tab but I honestly have no idea how I could have done that. I was also quite done with this project at release since the code was getting incredibly messy due to earlier inexperience. The game is stable and has surprisingly few bugs at this time though. **Future Plans** I am currently working on a spiritual successor to my first game titled 'Realms of Madness'. It takes all that worked in my first game and expands on it while fixing many things that didn't work. Here is a link to the new [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2501920/Realms_of_Madness) in case you would want to take a look. I am investing most of the money earned from the first game into making the next game the best it can possibly be. Additionally, I am working together with a team to create a small puzzle game scheduled for release at the end of this year. It is called 'Observe' and is a singleplayer puzzle game about collaboration. Here's the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738190/Observe). **I am looking forward to hearing all your thoughts. If you have any questions, please ask!**","response":"Первый релиз на Steam, продажи и результаты после 14 месяцев. **17 октября я запустил свою первую крупномасштабную игру. Вот результаты.** *Прежде чем я начну; я делал похожий пост четыре месяца назад, рассказывая о результатах на тот момент. Однако я считаю, что тогда не углубился достаточно в детали. Также мне хотелось бы обсудить планы на будущее.* **Введение** Моя первая игра называется 'Open The Gates!'. Это 2D платформенная строительная RTS-игра, вдохновленная такими играми, как Stronghold. Она ориентирована на людей, которым нравится стратегии без заморочек. Идеальный игрок - это тот, кто хочет просто начать игру, построить замок и отразить атаки врагов без необходимости изучения сложных механик или без усилий 'стать лучше'. Моя игра довольно проста, а учебник организован так, что игрок сам разбирается со всем. Если игроку что-то непонятно, озвученный персонаж поможет ему. *Если хотите самостоятельно оценить игру, вот ссылка!* [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332450/Open_The_Gates/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332450/Open_The_Gates/) **Игра** Моя игра - это строительный симулятор замка с довольно веселой графикой. Я работал вместе с художницей, которую нашел в интернете, она оказалась по-настоящему потрясающей, и я до сих пор работаю с ней над моим следующим проектом. Мы договорились о сниженной стоимости за активы в обмен на 20% от доходов. У этого расклада есть как плюсы, так и минусы. Огромным плюсом является то, что художник действительно интересуется игрой и в некотором роде относится к ней как к своему собственному проекту. Это превращает фрилансера в полноценного члена команды, что мне намного больше по душе. Одним из очевидных минусов является потеря значительной части дохода и задание прецедента, если вы хотите продолжить работать с этим человеком. Например, в моем следующем проекте я все еще отдаю 20% дохода художнику. **Исходный дизайн** **Мой исходный бюджет** на игру был скромным **350 долларов США**. Когда мне было 16 лет (сейчас мне 22), я впервые придумал идею для игры. Я составил [документ дизайна](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wVjX7DlcCBu0tmAzdFN4G5qIFGIRo6NYjzcpUvfMXKE/edit?usp=sharing), который написан ужасно, но все эти годы спустя его весело читать. Когда мне исполнилось 18, я вернулся к идее и решил продолжить работу над ней. **Разработка** Я начал совместную работу с другим художником, который добровольно создал несколько элементов для игры. Однако позже мы разошлись. Я все же указал этого человека как 'художника по концептам'. Год прошел, и ничего не происходило, пока я наконец не решил серьезно заняться игрой. Полноценная разработка началась в феврале 2020 года (незадолго до пандемии). Игра была выпущена через два с половиной года 17 октября 2022 года. Удивительно, но разработка прошла довольно гладко. Искусство и музыка были готовы через год, но из-за моего недостатка опыта программные части заняли больше времени, чем ожидалось. Например, код перемещения юнитов был переписан семь раз. В общей сложности я инвестировал в разработку этой игры 2000 евро. Деньги в основном шли на оплату художественных активов и оплату музыкантов. С музыкантом, который имел небольшой опыт в создании саундтреков для игр и который хотел написать музыку для игры за сниженный тариф, связался со мной. В итоге я заплатил 40 долларов США за минуту музыки, что, по моему мнению, было очень разумно. Он оказался довольно талантливым и в дальнейшем создал еще много качественных саундтреков. В игре много озвученных персонажей. Голоса озвучивали добровольцы-актеры и актрисы, которые сами обратились ко мне. Добавление озвученных персонажей в игру делает ее куда более живой. **Маркетинг до выпуска** У меня совершенно не было понимания, как маркетить игру. Я иногда публиковал посты в X (ранее Twitter), но ни один из них не стал популярным. Со страницы в Steam я получал около 1-3 списка желаемого в день просто от трафика сервиса. Страница запустилась в начале 2020 года, так что у нее было много времени для накопления желаемых игр. Однако наиболее важный момент предзапуска был на Steam Next Fest в июне 2022 года. Я выпустил демо-версию, не обращаясь ни к каким стримерам или ютуберам. Вероятно, это было не мудро, но я тогда не понимал важности Steam Next Fest. К счастью, мне очень повезло, поскольку мое демо подхватили некоторые известные ютуберы, такие как [SplatterCatGaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioQ8BKe76K0) и [BaronVonGames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9KFJcNq0Oo). Это привело к [огромному скачку](https://imgur.com/31TXkLK) в списках желаемого. В общей сложности я [получил 2882 списка желаемого](https://imgur.com/wfbBjCU) за три месяца. Это было весело! Количество желаемого ежедневно падало после июля и начинало расти только когда перед выпуском стали выходить видео. **Перед выпуском** Увидев, насколько успешными были видео/стримеры для демо, я решил отправить кучу электронных писем (с предварительными ключами) различным стримерам/ютуберам. Многие из них уже освещали демо, так что было легче убедить их также освещать полную игру. В общей сложности я отправил около 200 писем вручную, персонализируя каждое. На это ушло несколько дней труда, но я считаю, что это того стоило. Вот пресс-кит, который я отправлял вместе с письмом. Было много видео, освещающих игру, таких как [SplatterCatGaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHRBcRgmmvA), [BaronVonGames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU75CxfGy5w) и [Real Civil Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bn4cJxCQfE). Эти видео собрали много просмотров. В общем, я запустил свою игру с [4702 списками желаемого](https://imgur.com/ewXJ6RB). Этого было **недостаточно** для попадания в список ожидаемых. Факт того, что я не попал в этот список, вероятно, значительно навредил моим продажам. В будущем я не буду запускать игру с менее чем 7000 списками желаемого. **Продажи** [Нажмите здесь для полного финансового отчета по сегодняшний день.](https://imgur.com/mwPauXH) Кратко; Валовой доход: 27 601 доллар США. Чистый доход: 21 960 долларов США Однако, как уже обсуждалось ранее, художник получил 20%. Кроме того, была комиссия за перевод в банк в размере 9 евро, и я должен был заплатить налоги. Общая сумма, которую я заработал со всеми расходами, составила: **11 222 евро.** Мой [коэффициент конверсии списка желаемого](https://imgur.com/mXilqBD) составляет 11%, что ниже среднего согласно данным Steam. Интересно, что игра продолжает продаваться до сих пор. Каждый месяц я получаю чистую прибыль более 100 евро и нет реальных признаков замедления. Не уверен, как долго это продлится, у кого-нибудь есть идеи? **Отзывы** Я быстро получил 10 отзывов на Steam, что дало старт трафику в очереди открытий. Отзывы были в целом положительными, хотя есть [видео](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRgcpkFieds), которое полностью уничтожило мою игру. Это забавно смотреть, и я уважаю его мнение, он высказывает веские доводы и у меня нет к нему обид. Игра в настоящее время имеет 49 отзывов и классифицируется как 'В основном положительные'. Раздражает то, что она могла бы стать 'Очень положительной', если бы я получил еще один положительный отзыв... Ну что ж, таковы реалии! **Заключение** Игра имела умеренный успех как первый проект. Она могла бы принести больше, если бы мне каким-то образом удалось достать из воздуха примерно 2000 списков желаемого до запуска, чтобы попасть в список ожидаемых игр, но, честно говоря, я не представляю, как это можно было сделать. К моменту релиза я был также довольно утомлен этим проектом, так как код становился невероятно запутанным из-за ранних опытов. Однако на данный момент игра стабильна и имеет удивительно мало ошибок. **Планы на будущее** Я в настоящее время работаю над духовным преемником моей первой игры под названием 'Realms of Madness'. Она усваивает все то, что работало в моей первой игре, и развивает это, исправляя многие вещи, которые не сработали. Вот ссылка на новую [страницу в Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2501920/Realms_of_Madness), если вы хотели бы взглянуть. Я инвестирую большую часть заработанных на первой игре денег в то, чтобы сделать следующую игру лучше всего возможного. Кроме того, я работаю с командой над созданием небольшой головоломки, запланированной к выпуску в конце этого года. Она называется 'Observe' и представляет собой однопользовательскую головоломку о сотрудничестве.

CLINIC ROOM - NIGHT Irene glides across the room, her body language betraying her intent to appear weak and vulnerable. Erwin watches her curiously, unsure of the true reason behind her charade. ERWIN (gently) Irene, I can't help but feel that this act of helplessness is more than just for appearances. You're testing me, aren't you? Irene pauses, turning towards Erwin with a soft smile dancing on her lips. IRENE (sincere) Erwin, I apologize for the discomfort, but sometimes, risks must be taken to ensure our safety. It's not just about humiliating you; it's about protecting you too. Erwin's confusion gradually gives way to understanding, their unspoken connection resonating through their eyes. ---------- As their investigations deepen within the clinic's ominous walls, their bond grows stronger and more complex. Shadows of romance dance in the background, intertwining with the urgency to uncover the truth. Irene's vulnerability keeps Erwin on edge, questioning his own emotions as he battles between his loyalty to the investigation and his growing feelings for her.

With their lives hanging in the balance and the lines between friendship and romance blurred, Irene and Erwin must navigate the treacherous path to uncover the sinister truth while protecting their intricate bond. ---------- Note: The plotline introduction sets the stage for a mysterious journey that explores friendship, romance, and the complexities of human connection.

The emergence of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offers an innovative approach to IDS, boasting rapid computation, energy savings, and proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data. Nonetheless, the quest to balance high accuracy with operational efficiency in SNN-based IDS architectures is a formidable challenge. This paper conducts an extensive literature review on the optimization strategies employed to balance accuracy and efficiency in SNN-based IDS. We have systematically categorized these strategies into three primary groups: (1) network architecture optimization, (2) learning algorithm enhancement, and (3) data preprocessing and feature extraction methods. Within these categories, we summarize essential contributions to the current state of the art, highlight critical issues, and offer a roadmap for future research endeavors in this burgeoning field. 1. Introduction The increase in complexity and variety of network-based attacks necessitates more sophisticated and agile IDS to safeguard critical information systems. The integration of neural networks, particularly SNNs, into the IDS framework has been recognized as a progressive step in enhancing detection capabilities. SNNs are known for their bio-plausible computation models and have been shown to be particularly effective in capturing dynamic behavioral patterns indicative of intrusive activities. This paper provides an in-depth review of SNN-based IDS optimizations, highlighting key improvements and drawing attention to the extant gaps and potential research trajectories. **1.1 Background** IDSs are software or hardware tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and policy violations. Traditional IDSs relied heavily on rule-based or signature-based methods, which are less effective against new or complex intrusion patterns. The evolution toward machine learning and, subsequently, neural network-based IDSs offers an adaptive solution capable of learning from ongoing network activities. However, the implementation of conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been encumbered by high computation costs and energy requirements. In contrast, SNNs mimic the biological neural processing of the brain, introducing efficiencies particularly suited to low-power devices and real-time data analysis (Davies et al., 2021). **1.2 Significance of SNNs in IDS** SNNs stand out from other neural network paradigms through their utilization of temporal dynamics in neuronal firing, which makes them adept at handling time-dependent data, a common characteristic in network traffic. Additionally, SNNs can be deployed on neuromorphic hardware, which significantly reduces energy consumption and accelerates computation speed (Roy et al., 2019). These attributes position SNN-based IDS as a competitive choice in the quest for advanced intrusion detection technologies. 2. Optimization of Network Architectures **2.1 Improved Topologies and Neuron Models** Several studies have experimented with different SNN topologies to enhance detection rates and reduce false positives. For example, Feng et al. (2022) proposed a modular SNN architecture that improves the generalization of intrusion detection over diverse network scenarios. Neuron models, like the integrate-and-fire or the more sophisticated Izhikevich neurons, have also been explored for their ability to balance computational load with accurate spike encoding (Izhikevich, 2023). **2.2 Hardware Implementations** Mapping SNNs onto neuromorphic hardware has advanced the performance of IDS. Research by Singh et al. (2023) illustrates how using emerging memory technologies in neuromorphic chips can lead to latency reduction and energy savings while maintaining high detection rates. 3. Learning Algorithm Optimization **3.1 Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques** Both supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms have been applied to train SNNs for IDS purposes. Yang and Zhou (2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of a supervised learning rule that incorporates temporal credit assignment, enhancing the SNN's ability to discern intricate intrusion signatures. Conversely, Khera et al. (2023) presented an unsupervised approach that leverages the self-organizing capabilities of SNNs, enabling them to adapt to new threats without labeled data. **3.2 Reinforcement Learning and Meta-learning** The application of reinforcement learning (RL) to SNN-based IDS has been a focal point of recent studies. A framework presented by Patel and Lee (2023) combines RL with SNNs, fostering an environment where the system self-optimizes based on reward signals derived from detection performance. Meta-learning approaches have also been considered to tailor learning algorithms to specific network conditions, as detailed in the work of Zhao et al. (2023). 4. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering **4.1 Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Selection** The high dimensionality of network data is a significant challenge in IDS. Techniques to reduce feature space without losing critical information, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and autoencoders, have been beneficial (Mehta & Patel, 2023). Feature selection algorithms that identify the most relevant features for intrusion detection can also improve SNN efficiency (Jha & Sharma, 2023). **4.2 Signal Processing and Temporal Feature Extraction** Signal processing methods like wavelet transforms have been used to enhance the temporal features of network data before feeding it into an SNN, fostering improved detection of complex, time-dependent attack patterns (Garcia & Schmidt, 2023). 5. Discussion This review synthesizes current advancements and illuminates the complexities involved in optimizing SNN-based IDSs. We identify the synergistic potential of combining various optimization techniques and the need for comprehensive benchmarks that evaluate the performance of these systems in real-world scenarios. 6. Future Directions Future research could focus on the integration of SNN-based IDS into distributed network environments, the exploration of new learning paradigms that further reduce the computational footprint, and the development of more efficient neuromorphic hardware tailored for intrusion detection tasks. 7. Conclusion Optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in SNN-based IDS is paramount for achieving the next generation of network security systems.

Introduction The unprecedented growth of the internet and sophistication of cyberattacks necessitate advanced defensive strategies, particularly in the field of intrusion detection. Traditional methods often fall short due to high computational demands and inadequate real-time responses. SNNs bypass these limitations by emulating the human brain, fitting naturally into the domain of pattern detection and emerging as apt candidates for detecting complex intrusion patterns.

However, this type of fear could fall under a broader category of phobias related to sounds, music, or specific triggers, which might be a form of specific phobia—a type of anxiety disorder in which a person has an irrational fear of specific situations, objects, or activities. A few related terms, though not exactly as described, include: 1. Phonophobia - Fear of loud sounds. This might extend to fear of certain parts of a song if they are particularly loud or startling. 2. Musicophobia - Fear of music. It is extremely rare but could involve anxiety triggered by listening to music or certain types of music. 3. Melophobia - Fear of or aversion to music. Someone might experience anxiety related to music in general, rather than a specific part of a song. 4. Misophonia - This isn't exactly a fear, but rather a strong reaction to specific sounds. While it typically involves everyday sounds like chewing or breathing, it could conceivably extend to particular sounds in music. There can be several reasons for an aversive reaction to a specific part of a song: - Past Trauma: The part of the song may be associated with a traumatic event, eliciting a fear response upon hearing it. - Neurological issues: Sometimes, certain sounds or patterns can trigger negative neurological reactions in some individuals. - Individual Differences: Sensitivity to certain frequencies or patterns in music may cause discomfort or anxiety. If this fear or discomfort interferes with a person's daily functioning or well-being, it might be beneficial to consult a mental health professional to discuss the symptoms and explore possible treatment options like exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or other appropriate interventions."},{"prompt":"what is the most common fear of hearing the specific parts of a song?","response":"There isn't a widely recognized common fear associated specifically with hearing particular parts of a song. Fears and phobias typically relate to more general stimuli or situations rather than something as specific as parts of a song. However, certain parts of a song could trigger fear or discomfort in some people for various reasons. Here are a few scenarios where a specific part of a song might cause fear or distress: 1. Traumatic Association: If a specific part of a song was playing during a traumatic event in someone's life, hearing that part again might trigger a fear response due to the association with the trauma. 2. Lyric Content: Lyrics that are disturbing, violent, or relate to a personal fear might cause fear or anxiety for some listeners when those parts of the song are played. 3. Sensory Processing Sensitivity: Some individuals may have heightened sensitivity to sensory input and might find certain frequencies, volumes, or musical arrangements overwhelming or anxiety-inducing. 4. Phobias: Rarely, a part of a song could include sounds that resemble a phobic stimulus (e.g., a siren in the song resembling the phobic stimulus of loud alarms). 5. Misophonia: While not a fear, some individuals experience emotional distress or anxiety when hearing certain sounds that might occur in music, such as specific instruments or rhythms that trigger an aversive reaction. It's important to note that while these reactions can occur, there is no formal classification for a phobia tied to specific parts of a song. People with strong negative reactions to certain song parts may have an idiosyncratic response based on their unique experiences, sensitivities, and psychological makeup. Most people do not have an intense fear of specific parts of a song, so it is not considered a common fear. If someone does experience persistent fear or anxiety related to music, it would be advisable to consult with a mental health professional for a thorough assessment and appropriate support."},{"prompt":"why some people like to play the music that traumatizes people with musical aversion?","response":"When someone deliberately plays music that they know is distressing or traumatizing to someone with musical aversion, it could be motivated by various factors, some of which might include: 1. Ignorance: They might not be aware of the extent of the distress it causes the person with the aversion. They may not understand the psychological impact such an action can have. 2. Insensitivity: They may be aware that it causes discomfort but lack empathy or choose to disregard the other person's feelings. 3. Bullying or Power Dynamics: Playing triggering music could be a form of psychological bullying or a way to assert control or power over the distressed individual. 4. Incompatibility of Preferences: In some cases, the person playing the music simply has different tastes and doesn't place a high priority on the preferences or aversions of others. 5. Provocation: Some individuals might engage in this behavior for their amusement or to provoke a reaction, possibly due to a lack of maturity or a disposition towards antagonism. 6. Misunderstanding or Miscommunication: They might not understand how serious the aversion is, or there may have been a miscommunication about the specific trigger. It's important to communicate clearly if certain music causes distress or discomfort. Individuals who have a strong negative reaction to certain music should try to inform those around them about their aversion, and others should respect those sensitivities. If someone continues to play distressing music despite knowing it causes harm, it could be a sign of a more significant issue in the relationship or environment, and it might require addressing the problem more directly, setting boundaries, or seeking support from others."},{"prompt":"if musical aversion is not related to instrument, lyrics, or genre, what part of any song that triggers unease, stress and sometimes can cause others cry?","response":"Emotional reactions to music, including unease, stress, or tears, can arise from various non-specific elements of a song. Even when the aversion is not tied to a particular instrument, lyrics, or genre, other aspects of music can provoke strong emotional responses: 1. **Melody**: Certain melodies may evoke strong emotions due to their structure or the memories and associations they carry for the individual. 2. **Harmony**: Dissonant harmonies might create feelings of tension or unease, while certain chord progressions can evoke sadness or melancholy. 3. **Tempo**: The speed of a song can influence the listener's emotional state, with slower tempos often associated with reflective or sorrowful emotions. 4. **Rhythm**: Complex or unpredictable rhythms might induce feelings of stress or anxiety in some individuals. 5. **Dynamic Variations**: Sudden changes in volume or intensity may be startling or evoke unease, while crescendos can build emotional intensity that could lead to crying. 6. **Timbre**: The quality or 'color' of the musical sound, which can vary widely even between the same notes played on different instruments, may trigger an emotional response. 7. **Key**: Songs in minor keys are often perceived as more somber or melancholic and could induce sadness in listeners. 8. **Mode**: Modal music (differing from the major/minor key system) can introduce unique emotional qualities that might resonate differently with individuals. 9. **Musical Tension and Release**: Music often creates a narrative of tension and release, and the anticipation or delay of resolution can cause emotional reactions. 10. **Personal Associations**: Sometimes, music can be a trigger simply due to personal associations such as reminding one of a specific person, time, or place linked with strong emotions. It's also important to recognize that personal experiences and cultural backgrounds play a significant role in how individuals react to music. What causes a strong emotional reaction in one person might not affect another in the same way. If someone frequently experiences negative emotions when encountering music, and it impacts their quality of life, it might be beneficial to explore these reactions with a therapist or counselor who specializes in music therapy or another relevant field."},{"prompt":"explain those given list in detailed way and an examples that triggers fears and stress","response":"Certainly, let's explore each factor that might cause emotional reactions such as fear, stress, or tears in more detail and provide examples. It's worth noting that these responses can be highly individual and what affects one person might not affect another. 1. **Melody**: The sequence of notes in a melody can evoke emotions. For example, a descending melody might be perceived as sad or mournful. A melody that somebody associates with a funeral or a deeply emotional event can stir up those feelings again when heard. 2. **Harmony**: The combination of notes played together can create feelings of tension or resolution. A harmony that includes dissonant intervals (like minor seconds) might sound jarring or unsettling, causing discomfort or stress. Music from a horror film often uses dissonance to create a sense of fear or foreboding. 3. **Tempo**: The speed of the music can affect mood. A very fast tempo might induce anxiety or stress, as it can feel overwhelming or frenetic. Conversely, a dirge-like, slow tempo can elicit sorrow or sadness, such as the tempo typically used in funeral marches. 4. **Rhythm**: Complex, irregular, or rapidly changing rhythms might be hard to follow, potentially causing unease. For example, the use of unpredictable rhythms in the score of a suspenseful movie scene can keep listeners on edge. 5. **Dynamic Variations**: Changes in loudness can evoke surprise or fear, particularly if they're unexpected. In movies, a sudden loud burst of music is often used to accompany jump scares, eliciting an immediate fear response. 6. **Timbre**: This is the distinctive quality of a sound. A raspy, growling timbre might feel menacing, while a bright, sharp sound could be piercing or cause discomfort. The use of eerily played string instruments or a Theremin can create a spooky or otherworldly atmosphere that might unsettle listeners. 7. **Key**: A piece of music in a minor key can evoke a sadder feeling than one in a major key due to the way humans generally perceive the sound of these intervals. For instance, Samuel Barber's \\"Adagio for Strings\\" is renowned for its emotional impact and is often used to evoke a profound sense of loss or mourning. 8. **Mode**: Aside from major and minor keys, there are modal scales, such as Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian, each providing a different emotional color. For example, the Phrygian mode can create an exotic or unsettling feel used in certain ethnic or folk music, potentially causing distress or discomfort for sensitive individuals. 9. **Musical Tension and Release**: The anticipation built up by a composer before a climactic moment in a song, followed by the eventual release, can be a powerful emotional trip. The tension before the resolution might cause stress, while the release can lead to relief or even tears. 10. **Personal Associations**: This is a broad category, as any aspect of a song that reminds someone of a traumatic or stressful event can have a strong emotional impact. It can be a song that was playing during a car accident, for example, which might trigger anxiety when heard again. These examples are not exhaustive, and they touch upon some of the ways music can be psychologically potent and emotionally evocative. The specific music that triggers a fear or stress response will vary from person to person. The study of why and how music evokes such strong emotional responses is a complex field and is part of the broader study of music psychology and neuromusicology. If certain types of music consistently cause distress, individuals may seek the help of mental health professionals or music therapists who can offer strategies to cope with these reactions."},{"prompt":"what about the adlibs? is it considered as stressful or something?","response":"Ad-libs in music are impromptu, often improvised vocal embellishments, additions, or exclamations that are not part of the written lyrics or score. They can be heard across many genres, typically in hip-hop, R&B, pop, jazz, and live performances. The impact of ad-libs on listeners can vary greatly depending on a number of factors: 1. **Preference and Expectations**: Some listeners enjoy ad-libs as they add spontaneity and character to a performance, while others may find them distracting or unnecessary, especially if they prefer the structured version of a song. 2. **Execution**: Well-executed ad-libs by skilled artists can enhance the emotional depth of a song and may be uplifting or impressive to hear. However, if ad-libs are done poorly, they can disrupt the flow of the music and cause irritation or discomfort. 3. **Volume and Intensity**: Ad-libs that are much louder or more intense than the rest of the song can startle some listeners, potentially causing unease or stress, particularly if they are not anticipated. 4. **Frequency**: If ad-libs occur too frequently or overshadow the main vocals or melody, they might become overwhelming or annoying to the listener. 5. **Personal Associations**: As with other aspects of music, ad-libs may have personal associations for listeners. If a certain style of ad-lib reminds someone of a negative experience or is linked to a particular memory, it could trigger stress or discomfort. For the most part, ad-libs are not inherently stressful or distressing. They are a creative expression and a hallmark of certain musical styles. Whether or not ad-libs are perceived as stressful is subjective and depends on the listener's personal tastes, cultural background, past experiences, and the context in which the ad-libs are delivered. What's important to remember is that the emotional response to music, including elements like ad-libs, is highly individual. If ad-libs or any other musical elements consistently lead to negative feelings, it may help to understand the reasons behind these reactions, which could involve exploring individual sensitivities or psychological concerns with a professional."},{"prompt":"what about the adlibs and finales?","response":"Ad-libs and finales in music can both be significant in terms of their emotional impact on listeners, but they serve different purposes and may elicit different responses. **Ad-libs**, as mentioned earlier, are often spontaneous vocal additions that artists introduce to add creativity, personality, or emphasis to their performances. They can be found in recorded tracks as well as live performances, and their effects can be diverse: - For some, ad-libs can be exciting and add a layer of authenticity and flair. - For others, they might be distracting or seem out of place, especially if they disrupt the expected flow of the song. - Sometimes, ad-libs can be emotive and add to the build-up of a song's climax, enhancing the overall experience. **Finales** usually refer to the concluding parts of a piece of music or the last movement of a musical composition, and they tend to be carefully composed to provide closure. In the context of live performances or albums, a finale is often designed to be impactful and memorable: - A finale can be a powerful emotional release, bringing together thematic elements and musical ideas presented throughout the piece. - It can be loud, complex, and energetic, meant to leave the listener feeling exhilarated or moved. - Alternatively, a finale may be soft, slow, and reflective, aiming to leave the audience in a state of contemplation or catharsis. In both ad-libs and finales, the following aspects can influence the potential stress or emotional response they may evoke: - **Execution**: The quality and artistry with which ad-libs and finales are performed can greatly affect how they are received. Mastery can evoke admiration and pleasure, while poor execution can lead to discomfort or disappointment. - **Context**: The musical context in which ad-libs and finales occur is crucial. In a live concert, the energy of the crowd can intensify the emotional impact. In a recording, the production and mix can either highlight or diminish their effect. - **Personal Resonance**: Individual experiences and associations can shape emotional responses. A final performance of a beloved song might elicit tears, while unexpected and jarring ad-libs might cause unease or anxiety. Artists often aim to use ad-libs and finales to connect more deeply with their audiences, creating peak moments in their music that reinforce the desired emotional narrative of the work. But, like much of musical appreciation, reactions to them can be highly individual and subjective."},{"prompt":"but being done correctly, it could cause some traumatic listening and emotionally offensive to others. what are the other explanations on it?","response":"If ad-libs or finales are executed correctly and still cause traumatic listening experiences or are emotionally offensive to some listeners, several explanations could be at play. These reactions generally stem from individual listener differences, as the same piece of music can impact people in vastly different ways: 1. **Personal Trauma and Triggers**: A listener may have had a negative or traumatic experience associated with a specific piece of music. If the finale or ad-libs of a song remind the listener of this event, it could reactivate feelings related to the trauma. 2. **Heightened Emotional Sensitivity**: Some individuals may have a heightened sensitivity to emotional stimuli in music. Emotional passages, intense ad-libs, or powerful finales can sometimes provoke a strong response that could lead to feelings of being overwhelmed. 3. **Cultural and Social Context**: What might be considered emotionally intense or offensive can vary greatly across cultures and social groups. Listeners from different backgrounds may interpret and react to musical elements based on their cultural norms and values. 4. **Lyric Content and Delivery**: Even when executed with technical precision, certain lyrics delivered as ad-libs or during a finale might contain messages or themes that are offensive or triggering to some people. 5. **Interpersonal Dynamics**: In some cases, if there's a negative interpersonal dynamic between the listener and the performer (or between the listener and another person associated with the song), this could taint the listener's emotional response to otherwise well-executed musical elements. 6. **Musical Conditioning**: Listeners might be conditioned to respond negatively to certain types of music due to past experiences where those types of music were associated with negative events or feelings. 7. **Mental Health Factors**: Individuals with certain mental health conditions may have more intense or unexpected emotional responses to music. For example, someone with anxiety might find a particularly intense finale to cause increased stress. It's important to recognize that while music has universal properties that can affect people in common ways, personal experiences and psychological makeup lead to a unique emotional experience for each listener. What is moving and profound to one person might be distressing to another. It's a reflection of the complex interplay between sound, individual psychology, and cultural context. In situations where music consistently causes distress or trauma, it may be advisable for the affected individual to speak with a mental health professional who can help them explore the root cause of their reactions and develop coping strategies."},{"prompt":"你是一个资深的股票分析师，总结下面的资讯，给出重点的信息，简述给我： style=\\"display:none;height:1px;overflow:hidden;\\"><br /></p><!-- EM_StockImg_Start --><p fy=\\"off\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\"><a href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" data-code=\\"002410|0|2\\" data-code2=\\"002410|0|6|\\" class=\\"EmImageRemark\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><img src='https://webquoteklinepic.eastmoney.com/GetPic.aspx?nid=0.002410&imageType=KNEWS3' width='578' height='' style='border:#d1d1d1 1px solid;' /></a></p><!-- EM_StockImg_End --><center style=\\"text-align:left;\\"><div class=\\"em_adv_mods\\" type=\\"1\\" tag=\\"6\\" style=\\"display:none;\\"></div></center><p>1月8日下午，网传知名软件公司<span id=\\"stock_0.002410\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/0.002410.html\\">广联达</a></span><span id=\\"quote_0.002410\\"></span>全体员工的年终绩效将强制清零。对此，<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/0.002410.html\\">广联达</a></span>有关负责人回应记者称，这个传闻是不准确的，没有全体员工年终绩效清零的说法。“<span web=\\"1\\" href=\\"http://quote.eastmoney.com/unify/r/0.002410\\" class=\\"em_stock_key_common\\" data-code=\\"0,002410\\">广联达</span>整体<span id=\\"Info.3321\\">业绩</span>确实面临压力，广联达对员工绩效奖金也作出了判定。目前，广联达公司经营团队对整体经营结果担责，经营团队年度奖金为零，但公司会根据绩效结果对员工进行相应的激励，需要一定的时间去落实，希望也能得到员工的理解。”上述负责人称。</p><p fy=\\"off\\" class=\\"em_media\\">（文章来源：中国<span id=\\"bk_90.BK0473\\"><a href=\\"https://wap.eastmoney.com/quote/stock/90.BK0473.html\\">证券</a></span><span id=\\"bkquote_90.BK0473\\"></span>报·中证金牛座）","response":"根据上述资讯，知名软件公司广联达的年终绩效并未被强制清零。负责人回应称，该传闻不准确，公司对员工绩效奖金进行了评定。尽管公司经营团队年度奖金为零，但公司会根据绩效结果对员工进行相应的激励，并需要一定时间来落实。此外，广联达整体业绩面临压力。"},{"prompt":"Первый терминологический словарь медицинской лексики, «Анатомико-физиологический словарь» Н.М.

Русская медицина тоже претерпела подобные этапы эволюции, обогащаясь и впитывая в себя лучшее от иных национальных медицинских школ. Сопутствующее формирование медицинской терминологии также вышло на путь самобытного развития, прошедшего стадии заимствования и адаптации до выработки уникального национального характера. Исторические корни русской терминологической работы уходят в глубокую древность – к наследию древнегреческой, римской и Византийской культур. Источники античной медицинской терминологии можно отследить на протяжении четырёх тысячелетий до культур древней Вавилонии-Ассирии и Египта. В 2500 году до нашей эры Месопотамия дала миру первые библиотеки, содержащие клинописные таблицы с записями о медицинских знаниях[ 玛格纳著. 医学史(第2版)[M]. 刘学礼译. 上海: 上海人民出版社，2009: 22.]. Но рациональная медицина, как мы её понимаем, зародилась в V веке до нашей эры, в период, когда древнегреческая медицина начала своё могущество. Творения Гиппократа и Аристотеля, а также обширный корпус медицинской литературы Александрийской библиотеки заложили фундамент для первоначального формирования медицинской терминологии. Древние энциклопедии, разработанные в ту эпоху, в том числе «О медицине» («De Medicna») Цельса, «Девять книг об обучении» («Nine Books of Disciplines») Варрона, а «О медицинской материи» («De materia medica») Диоскорида и «Естественная история» («Naturalis Historia») Плиния Старшего, обогащали знания в области ботаники и фармакологии. За время препровождение “великого отца медицины” Гиппократа, во II веке нашей эры римлянин К. Гален выдвинулся как создатель обширной системы медицинских и биологических знаний, которая стала краеугольным камнем европейских учений на протяжении всего Средневековья. Он создал многочисленные трактаты на греческом языке и предложил первые подходы к толкованию термина, заключающиеся в однозначном толковании и применении каждого специального слова/термина[ Е.В. Гордиенко. Зарождение медицинской терминографии сквозь призму форми/рования и развития медицинской терминологии.//Актуальные проблемы романо-германской филологии и методики преподавания иностранных языков. Материалы IX международной конференции. 2019. с. 130–134.]. Это свидетельствует о зарождении теоретических основ терминографии в то время. Период с IV по VII век ознаменовался рассветом византийской энциклопедической медицины. Византийская культура, в свою очередь, является наследнием античных греко-римских традиций. Медицинские знания Византии опирались на труды Гиппократа и Галена. Византийские учёные-медики составляли обстоятельные медицинские энциклопедии, собирая и систематизируя известное медицинское наследие и практический опыт. Самым значительным из этих трудов считается 72-томное произведение Орибасия «Врачебное собрание» («Collecta medicinalis»), из которого до нас дошло только 27 томов. По просьбе своего сына Евстафия, который изучал медицину, Орибасий составил сокращенный вариант своего обширного свода, так называемый «Обозрение» («Synopsis») в 9 книгах, который стал пособием для изучающих врачебные науки. Взаимодействие между разными цивилизациями позволило медицинским знаниям проникать и взаимно обогащать друг друга. После IX века обширный корпус медицинских текстов, включая работы Гиппократа и Галена, был передан из Византии в арабский и европейский медицинский мир. Многие древние тексты, утраченные в Европе, переводились обратно из арабских версий на латынь, обогащая европейскую культуру. Восточная Европа и Россия испытали наиболее сильное влияние византийской культуры – уже в IX веке распространение византийских традиций достигло максимального успеха в славянских землях. Впоследствии перевод греческих текстов на славянские языки заложил основу для развития русской медицинской терминологии. Период зарождение ( IX–XV вв.) Начальный этап истории русской лексикографии относится к XI веку, как указывают Козырев В. А. и Черняк В. Д. в своём исследовании «Вселенная в алфавитном порядке»[ Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке[M]. СПб.: РГПУ им. А. И. Герцена, 2000: 18.]. Зарождение первых русских словарных трудов было обусловлено развитием письменности и возникшей необходимостью истолкования непонятных слов из древних рукописей. Глоссы, то есть объяснения значений слов, представленные на полях старинных манускриптов, предшествовали созданию словарей. Эти первичные лексикографические прототипы с течением времени преобразовались в глоссарии — списки, приложенные к определённым текстам, и впоследствии в словарные своды, лексиконы и азбуковники. Активизация переводческой деятельности, датированная серединой XI века, достигла своего апогея в период позднего XII — начала XIII века[ 希尔德·德·里德-西蒙斯. 欧洲大学史. 中世纪大学(第1卷)[M]. 张斌贤译. 保定: 河北大学出版社, 2008: 341.]. Отмечается, что практическая значимость медицинской дисциплины притягивала внимание средневековых общин, что стимулировало перевод и распространение медицинских знаний среди первых[ 高燕. 欧洲中世纪大学医学专业化教育研究（11-14世纪）[D]. 河北医科大学博士学位论文, 2022: 65.]. Такие труды, как работы Аристотеля, Гиппократа, Галена и византийских медиков, были переведены с латыни и греческого языков на церковнославянский, что потребовало глассировке текстов этих памятников. Таким образом, можно утверждать, что именно в XI веке в Киевской Руси были заложены основы медицинской терминографии. Однако с серединой XIII века, в эпоху монголо-татарского нашествия и последующего доминирования, наблюдается замедление прогресса в области русской медицины и, как следствие, лексикографии. Ситуация стагнации в словарном деле сохранялась до конца XV века и начала меняться только с укреплением Московского государства, проявившего возобновленный интерес к научным и культурным достижениям, в том числе в сфере медицины. Период развития ( XVI—XVII вв.) «» В конце XVI века получал окончательное оформление особый жанр русской книжности — азбуковники, которые объединили в своём составе грамматические и словарные опыты средневековья[Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке]. Это был новым, своеобразным типом словарного труда, который, по словам В.В. Виноградова, представлял собой «смесь словаря иностранных и непонятных слов со своего рода реальной энциклопедией, куда вносились, обычно в азбучном порядке, разные любопытные сведения»[ВиноградовВ.В.Русскаянаукаорусскомлитературномязыке//УченыезапискиМосковскогоун-та. М., 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. С. 25. ]. Высшим достижением этого типа словарей того времени был словарь, составленный известным русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII веке. Всего он собрал три азубковников. Третий является самым полным представителем древнерусских тезаурусов, содержит 16 110 словарных статей, объединяет в себе материалы по географии, ботанике, зоологии, астрономии, минералогии, медицине и др. В словаре содержлись статьи лекарственных растений, названия котроых из разных языков были переведены с использованием русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций или иллюстраций. содержащим сведения о лекарственных свойствах растений[ Сапожникова О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в.[J]. Вестник Альянс-Архео, 2016(14): 11-40.]. В указанный период русская медицина претерпевала существенные изменения, постепенно интегрируя в себя достижения западноевропейской науки. В связи с этим и медицинская терминология развивалась, адаптируясь к быстрому прогрессу западноевропейской медицины в Раннем Новом времени. В 1654 году в России открылась первая Лекарская школа[ Грицак, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где в качестве учебников использовались переведенные европейские учебные пособия, включая \\"Эпитоме\\" Везалия. Этот авторский краткий обзор из сочинения «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543) был переведен в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, выдающимся просветителем того времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[ Николаева Н.Г. Индивидуальное начало в переводческом творчестве Епифания Славинецкогоа — Ученые записки Казанского университета. Сер: Гуманитарные науки. 2014. Т. 156, № 5. С. 30–40. ]. Отдельного упоминания заслуживает английский врач Марк Ридли, чей вклад в развитие русской научной лексики был весьма значителен. Ридли не только ввёл множество новых терминов в русский язык в области естественных наук и медицины, но и создал три словаря англо-русского и русско-английского, содержащих около 6000 слов. В словарях также были специальные приложения с названиями животных, растений и болезней[ Мирский : Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв.[M]. Владикавказ: Реклам.-изд. агентство Госкомиздата РСО-А, 1995:12.]. Период становления ( XVIII—XIX вв.) XVIII век стал переломным периодом в истории русской лексикографии. С начала этого века наблюдался значительный переход к книгопечатанию, что способствовало интенсивному развитию словарного дела. Известно о 277 лексикографических трудах, выпущенных в России в XVIII веке[ Вомперский. В.П. Словари XVIII в. М. 1986.]. Они можно классифицировать в четыре основных типа: переводные словари (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные), словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, а также специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[ Биржакова Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII в. СПб. 2010.]. В указанном веке реформы в сфере медицинского управления и инновации в медицинском образовании в России сыграли ключевую роль в формировании национальных медицинских кадров. В связи с этими изменениями возникла острая потребность в разработке учебных словарей, и в ответ на этот запрос был создан ряд многоязычных и двуязычных словарей, включающих медицинские термины. Особое внимание заслуживает «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, изданный в Москве в 1704 году. Этот словарь включал в себя 19712 статей, в которых значительное количество названий болезней и лекарственных трав было представлено на греческом, латинском и русском языках[ Е.В. Бекишева. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, С. 260-264.], либо описательное обозначение; реже использовались заимствования и латинизмы. К концу XVIII века в России был создан первый толковый словарь национального языка – «Словарь Российской академии» (1789-1794), который ознаменовал собой важную веху и вступление русской лексикографии в период научных академических словарей. Словарь включал более чем 600 медицинских терминов, в том числе народные общеупотребительные русские наименования, а также заимствованные научные термины греко-латинского происхождения[ Е.В. Бекишева. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, С. 260-264.]. Слова сопровождались весьма полными, тщательно сформулированными определениями. Медицинскую часть словаря составляли ведущие русские ученые врачи А.П. Протасов и Н.Я. Озерцковский. В XIX веке был опубликован «Толковый словарь живого великорусского языка» В.И. Даля (1863-1866), который содержит анатомические и хирургические термины, народные выражения, относящиеся к лечению больных, подробные описания латинских выражений. Будучи выдающимся знатоком русского языка, чутким ценителем, собирателем и хранителем сокровищ русскоого слова, Даль отстаивал исконно русскую лексику, наделяя ее несвойственным специальным медицинским значением. И в этом плане его многолетний словарный труд оценивается как «универсальное уникальное явление, в полной мере отразившее эрудицию профессионального врача и чутье увлеченного лингвиста. <...> это отражение эпохи активных поисков и трудов, времени формирования медицинской терминологии, соединившей в себе как заимствования из иных языков, так и живую образную речь русского народа»[ Папшева Г. О. , Голубцова Н. В. , Матвеева О. Н. . Семантические особенности медицинской лексики в «Толковом словаре» В. И. Даля — Вестник СВФУ. 2021. № 3, с. 106–116.]. Первым значительным этапом в развитии русской медицинской терминологии является создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году. Известный своим вкладом в медицину, просветительство и переводы, Максимович-Амбодик также стоял у истоков акушерской науки в России, заложив основы для её развития, и сделал значимый шаг вперёд в разработке лексикографии. Его труд, представленный в виде трехъязычного переводного словаря с алфавитно-гнездовой структурой, содержал более 6000 статей и имел учебное направление, являясь помощью для обучения будущих врачей, что подчеркивается и в титуле издания – «для пользы российскаго юношества»[ Касьяненко Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XVIII В. : «анатомико-физиологический словарь» 1783 Г. Н. М. Максимовича-амбодика. — Ученые записки Крымского федерального университета имени В. И. Вернадского. Филологические науки. Том 4 (70). № 3, С. 168–186.]. Данное терминологическое издание стало начальным пунктом развития жанра медицинских словарей. Продолжением этого вектора стал выпуск другого труда того же автора«Медико-патологико-хирургического словаря» (1785) , в котором были зафиксированы названия болезней и описания их симптоматики, а также упоминались сложные манипуляции, характерные для хирургической практики того времени, такие как перевязки и операции. Дополнительным вкладом в развитие медицинской терминологии стал «Врачебный словарь», созданный доктором медицины А.Н. Никитиным в 1835 году. Никитин, также являвшийся пионером отечественной педиатрии и активным участником Общества русских врачей в Санкт-Петербурге, разработал словарь с примерно 4000 статьями, охватывающими различные области медицинской науки, включая анатомию, физиологию, терапию, хирургию, офтальмологию, акушерство и гинекологию, а также содержит наименования медицинских инструментов, лекарственных препаратов, лечебных процедур, классификации заболеваний и расстройства питания.. Структура большинства статей в словаре подчиняется установленной схеме: вначале представляется латинский медицинский термин, который служит заглавием статьи, затем следуют его русские эквиваленты (или короткое определение), после чего предоставляется этимологический комментарий. Некоторые статьи словаря дополнены энциклопедической информацией, которая отражает уровень медицинских знаний соответствующего исторического периода. В этом плане «Врачебный словарь» может рассматривать как толково-переводной словарь, сочетающий в себе различные жанры[ Касьяненко Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XIX В. : «Врачебный словарь» А. Н. Никитина. — Вестник ДонНУ. Сер. Д: Филология и психология.2021.№ 1, С. 39–44. ].

Многие древние тексты, утраченные в Европе, переводились обратно из арабских версий на латынь, обогащая европейскую культуру. Восточная Европа и Россия испытали наиболее сильное влияние византийской культуры – уже в IX веке распространение византийских традиций достигло максимального успеха в славянских землях. Впоследствии перевод греческих текстов на славянские языки заложил основу для развития русской медицинской терминологии. Зарождение русской медицинской терминографии: XI-XV века Начальный этап истории русской лексикографии относится к XI веку, как указывают Козырев В. А. и Черняк В. Д. в своём исследовании «Вселенная в алфавитном порядке»[ Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке[M]. СПб.: РГПУ им. А. И. Герцена, 2000: 18.]. Зарождение первых русских словарных трудов было обусловлено развитием письменности и возникшей необходимостью истолкования непонятных слов из древних рукописей. Глоссы, то есть объяснения значений слов, представленные на полях старинных манускриптов, предшествовали созданию словарей. Эти первичные лексикографические прототипы с течением времени преобразовались в глоссарии — списки, приложенные к определённым текстам, и впоследствии в словарные своды, лексиконы и азбуковники. Активизация переводческой деятельности, датированная серединой XI века, достигла своего апогея в период позднего XII — начала XIII века[ 希尔德·德·里德-西蒙斯. 欧洲大学史. 中世纪大学(第1卷)[M]. 张斌贤译. 保定: 河北大学出版社, 2008: 341.]. Отмечается, что практическая значимость медицинской дисциплины притягивала внимание средневековых общин, что стимулировало перевод и распространение медицинских знаний среди первых[ 高燕. 欧洲中世纪大学医学专业化教育研究（11-14世纪）[D]. 河北医科大学博士学位论文, 2022: 65.]. Такие труды, как работы Аристотеля, Гиппократа, Галена и византийских медиков, были переведены с латыни и греческого языков на церковнославянский, что потребовало глассировке текстов этих памятников. Таким образом, можно утверждать, что именно в XI веке в Киевской Руси были заложены основы медицинской терминографии. Однако с серединой XIII века, в эпоху монголо-татарского нашествия и последующего доминирования, наблюдается замедление прогресса в области русской медицины и, как следствие, лексикографии. Ситуация стагнации в словарном деле сохранялась до конца XV века и начала меняться только с укреплением Московского государства, проявившего возобновленный интерес к научным и культурным достижениям, в том числе в сфере медицины. Расцвет переводческой деятельности и первые словари: XVI-XVII века В конце XVI века получал окончательное оформление особый жанр русской книжности — азбуковники, которые объединили в своём составе грамматические и словарные опыты средневековья[Козырев В. А., Черняк В. Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке]. Это был новым, своеобразным типом словарного труда, который, по словам В.В. Виноградова, представлял собой «смесь словаря иностранных и непонятных слов со своего рода реальной энциклопедией, куда вносились, обычно в азбучном порядке, разные любопытные сведения»[ВиноградовВ.В.Русскаянаукаорусскомлитературномязыке//УченыезапискиМосковскогоун-та. М., 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. С. 25. ]. Высшим достижением этого типа словарей того времени был словарь, составленный известным русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII веке. Всего он собрал три азубковников. Третий является самым полным представителем древнерусских тезаурусов, содержит 16 110 словарных статей, объединяет в себе материалы по географии, ботанике, зоологии, астрономии, минералогии, медицине и др. В словаре содержлись статьи лекарственных растений, названия котроых из разных языков были переведены с использованием русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций или иллюстраций. содержащим сведения о лекарственных свойствах растений[ Сапожникова О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в.[J]. Вестник Альянс-Архео, 2016(14): 11-40.]. В указанный период русская медицина претерпевала существенные изменения, постепенно интегрируя в себя достижения западноевропейской науки. В связи с этим и медицинская терминология развивалась, адаптируясь к быстрому прогрессу западноевропейской медицины в Раннем Новом времени. В 1654 году в России открылась первая Лекарская школа[ Грицак, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где в качестве учебников использовались переведенные европейские учебные пособия, включая \\"Эпитоме\\" Везалия. Этот авторский краткий обзор из сочинения «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543) был переведен в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, выдающимся просветителем того времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[ Николаева Н.Г. Индивидуальное начало в переводческом творчестве Епифания Славинецкогоа — Ученые записки Казанского университета. Сер: Гуманитарные науки. 2014. Т. 156, № 5. С. 30–40. ]. Отдельного упоминания заслуживает английский врач Марк Ридли, чей вклад в развитие русской научной лексики был весьма значителен. Ридли не только ввёл множество новых терминов в русский язык в области естественных наук и медицины, но и создал три словаря англо-русского и русско-английского, содержащих около 6000 слов. В словарях также были специальные приложения с названиями животных, растений и болезней[ Мирский : Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв.[M]. Владикавказ: Реклам.-изд. агентство Госкомиздата РСО-А, 1995:12.]. Переломный XVIII век: начало научной лексикографии в России и становление медицинской терминографии XVIII век стал переломным периодом в истории русской лексикографии. С начала этого века наблюдался значительный переход к книгопечатанию, что способствовало интенсивному развитию словарного дела. Известно о 277 лексикографических трудах, выпущенных в России в XVIII веке[ Вомперский. В.П. Словари XVIII в. М. 1986.]. Они можно классифицировать в четыре основных типа: переводные словари (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные), словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, а также специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[ Биржакова Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII в. СПб. 2010.]. В указанном веке реформы в сфере медицинского управления и инновации в медицинском образовании в России сыграли ключевую роль в формировании национальных медицинских кадров. В связи с этими изменениями возникла острая потребность в разработке учебных словарей, и в ответ на этот запрос был создан ряд многоязычных и двуязычных словарей, включающих медицинские термины. Особое внимание заслуживает «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, изданный в Москве в 1704 году. Этот словарь включал в себя 19712 статей, в которых значительное количество названий болезней и лекарственных трав было представлено на греческом, латинском и русском языках[ Е.В. Бекишева. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, С. 260-264.], либо описательное обозначение; реже использовались заимствования и латинизмы. К концу XVIII века в России был создан первый толковый словарь национального языка – «Словарь Российской академии» (1789-1794), который ознаменовал собой важную веху и вступление русской лексикографии в период научных академических словарей. Словарь включал более чем 600 медицинских терминов, в том числе народные общеупотребительные русские наименования, а также заимствованные научные термины греко-латинского происхождения[ Е.В. Бекишева. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, С. 260-264.]. Слова сопровождались весьма полными, тщательно сформулированными определениями. Медицинскую часть словаря составляли ведущие русские ученые врачи А.П. Протасов и Н.Я. Озерцковский. В XIX веке был опубликован «Толковый словарь живого великорусского языка» В.И. Даля (1863-1866), который содержит анатомические и хирургические термины, народные выражения, относящиеся к лечению больных, подробные описания латинских выражений. Будучи выдающимся знатоком русского языка, чутким ценителем, собирателем и хранителем сокровищ русскоого слова, Даль отстаивал исконно русскую лексику, наделяя ее несвойственным специальным медицинским значением. И в этом плане его многолетний словарный труд оценивается как «универсальное уникальное явление, в полной мере отразившее эрудицию профессионального врача и чутье увлеченного лингвиста. <...> это отражение эпохи активных поисков и трудов, времени формирования медицинской терминологии, соединившей в себе как заимствования из иных языков, так и живую образную речь русского народа»[ Папшева Г. О. , Голубцова Н. В. , Матвеева О. Н. . Семантические особенности медицинской лексики в «Толковом словаре» В. И. Даля — Вестник СВФУ. 2021. № 3, с. 106–116.]. Первым значительным этапом в развитии русской медицинской терминологии является создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году. Известный своим вкладом в медицину, просветительство и переводы, Максимович-Амбодик также стоял у истоков акушерской науки в России, заложив основы для её развития, и сделал значимый шаг вперёд в разработке лексикографии. Его труд, представленный в виде трехъязычного переводного словаря с алфавитно-гнездовой структурой, содержал более 6000 статей и имел учебное направление, являясь помощью для обучения будущих врачей, что подчеркивается и в титуле издания – «для пользы российскаго юношества»[ Касьяненко Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XVIII В. : «анатомико-физиологический словарь» 1783 Г. Н. М. Максимовича-амбодика. — Ученые записки Крымского федерального университета имени В. И. Вернадского. Филологические науки. Том 4 (70). № 3, С. 168–186.]. Данное терминологическое издание стало начальным пунктом развития жанра медицинских словарей. Продолжением этого вектора стал выпуск другого труда того же автора«Медико-патологико-хирургического словаря» (1785) , в котором были зафиксированы названия болезней и описания их симптоматики, а также упоминались сложные манипуляции, характерные для хирургической практики того времени, такие как перевязки и операции. Дополнительным вкладом в развитие медицинской терминологии стал «Врачебный словарь», созданный доктором медицины А.Н. Никитиным в 1835 году. Никитин, также являвшийся пионером отечественной педиатрии и активным участником Общества русских врачей в Санкт-Петербурге, разработал словарь с примерно 4000 статьями, охватывающими различные области медицинской науки, включая анатомию, физиологию, терапию, хирургию, офтальмологию, акушерство и гинекологию, а также содержит наименования медицинских инструментов, лекарственных препаратов, лечебных процедур, классификации заболеваний и расстройства питания.. Структура большинства статей в словаре подчиняется установленной схеме: вначале представляется латинский медицинский термин, который служит заглавием статьи, затем следуют его русские эквиваленты (или короткое определение), после чего предоставляется этимологический комментарий. Некоторые статьи словаря дополнены энциклопедической информацией, которая отражает уровень медицинских знаний соответствующего исторического периода. В этом плане «Врачебный словарь» может рассматривать как толково-переводной словарь, сочетающий в себе различные жанры[ Касьяненко Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XIX В. : «Врачебный словарь» А. Н. Никитина. — Вестник ДонНУ. Сер. Д: Филология и психология.2021.№ 1, С. 39–44. ]. С точки зрения содержания словаря, предоставляемая информация оказывается более обширной, что свидетельствует постепенное созревание концепции терминографии в России. Таким образом, в XVIII-XIX веках основной целью составления медицинской терминологии в России было удовлетворение потребностей медицинского образования и подготовки медицинских кадров. В этот период появились самостоятельные медицинские словари, что стало символом официального формирования русской медицинской терминографии; в то время как в переводных словарях неспециализированного типа и одноязычных подробных словарях медицинская терминология, как неотъемлемая часть системы русского словарного состава, занимала своё место в структуре словарных статей. Заключение В процессе выявления исторических этапов развития русской медицинской терминографии была отмечена её тесная связь с потребностями медицинского образования и формирования национальной медицинской школы. Создание медицинских словарей в XVIII-XIX веках в России стало отражением потребности в систематизации и унификации медицинских терминов как для учебных целей, так и для практического применения. Словари таких учёных, как Максимович-Амбодик и Никитин, сыграли фундаментальную роль в формировании специализированной медицинской лексики и способствовали развитию научной мысли и культуры в этой области. Изучение их трудов свидетельствует о постепенном созревании концепции терминографии, что отразилось в значимом вкладе в образовательный процесс и культурное развитие Росси.","response":"Ваш текст выглядит как готовая статья, включающая аннотацию, ключевые слова, введение и основные разделы, посвящённые истории развития медицинской терминологии в России.

Лексикографические труды того периода, в том числе издания Н.М. Максимовича-Амбодика и А.Н. Никитина, стали знаковыми поскольку они не только обеспечили основу для унификации медицинского языка, но и способствовали подготовке квалифицированных медицинских специалистов. Словари того времени отображают динамику и разнообразие медицинских знаний, а также служат ключевым свидетельством межкультурного обмена, который обогатил русскую медицинскую науку идеями и практиками со всего мира.

One dimension of reading fluency is reading rate, or reading speed. Because of the importance of reading fluency, fluency development activities should be incorporated into classroom practice. One activity that meets the fluency development conditions proposed by Nation (2007) is speed reading. An important question is whether reading speed gains measured in words per minute on controlled speed reading texts transfer to other types of texts. This paper reports on a preliminary, small-scale investigation of this question. The findings suggest that a speed reading course may contribute to faster reading speeds on other types of texts, but there remains a need for further experimental research into the impact of speed reading courses. Keywords: reading speed, reading rate, reading fluency, speed reading, reading fluency development The importance of reading speed to successful reading is neatly portrayed in the two contrasting circles of the weak reader and the good reader (Nuttall, 1996, p. 127). In “the virtuous circle of the good reader” reading faster is linked to greater quantity of reading, better understanding, and greater enjoyment, whereas in “the vicious circle of the weak reader” lack of understanding, lack of enjoyment, lack of reading, and slow reading feed off each other. It is the teacher’s role, therefore, to help learners move from this “cycle of frustration and enter instead the cycle of growth” that the virtuous circle represents. One way of achieving this is through attention to reading fluency. Fluency skills in reading, Hudson (2007, p. 80) pointed out, “are directed at allowing the reader to see larger sentences and phrases as wholes, a process which assists in reading more quickly.” While, as Grabe (2009, p. 292) pointed out, reading fluency is an underresearched area in second language settings, its various dimensions have been receiving increasing attention; Grabe (2009, pp. 291–292) discussed four dimensions: automaticity, accuracy, reading rate, and prosodic structuring, with automaticity and accuracy of word recognition being considered prerequisites for a rapid reading rate. Reading rate, or reading speed, is then a component of fluency, which may be loosely described as the ability to produce and process the target language with native speaker-like ease, and attention to fluency development should form part of any balanced language course. Nation (2007) described fluency Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 105 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) development as one of the four strands of a language course, and advised devoting roughly equal time to it and to the other three: meaning focused input, language focused learning, and meaning focused output. In order to be regarded as fluency development, Nation argued, activities need to meet a number of conditions, which are (a) all that the learners are listening to, reading, speaking or writing is largely familiar to them; (b) the learners’ focus is on receiving or conveying meaning; (c) there is some pressure or encouragement to perform at a faster than usual speed; and (d) there is a large amount of input or output. In the classroom, the three principal approaches to increase reading speed—easy extensive reading, repeated reading, and speed reading—all meet these conditions for fluency development to a considerable extent. 1. Extensive reading can be undertaken for either language development or fluency development goals (Hu & Nation, 2000, p. 423; Nation & Wang, 1999, p. 375). In easy extensive reading (Nation, 2009, p. 69) learners read materials that contain only known vocabulary; they are reading for pleasure, so receiving meaning is the focus; and they are reading a lot. The condition relating to faster performance is usually met by establishing targets or goals, such as reading for a set amount of time each day, or reading a book a week. A number of research studies have established a link between extensive reading and reading speed (e.g., Bell, 2001; Iwahori, 2008). 2. Repeated reading requires the learners to read the same text repeatedly, either silently or aloud. Nation (2009, p. 66) explained how this activity meets all his conditions for fluency development. There are several possible ways in which repeated reading can be implemented, with one variation being the amount of support provided to the learners. For example, in assisted repeated reading learners read and simultaneously listen to the text during some of the re-reading stages. In foreign language teaching, assisted repeated reading has been found to be effective in developing fluency as measured in words per minute (wpm), but with no significant difference between the impact of repeated reading and extensive reading (Taguchi, Takayasu-Maass, & Gorsuch, 2004). 3. Speed reading courses usually consist of a set number of texts of a fixed length, written within a restricted lexicon, followed by several multi-choice questions. The presence of the questions encourages learners to read the texts for understanding, rather than focus on skimming the text as quickly as possible. Such courses meet all Nation’s conditions for fluency development. Because the texts are written with a restricted, known vocabulary all that the learners are reading is expected to be familiar to them, and as comprehension questions follow each text the learners’ focus is on receiving meaning. At the same time, as learners are recording both their speed and their comprehension scores for each text there is some encouragement to perform at a faster than usual speed. The condition requiring a large amount of input is met by the number of texts. The use of speed reading courses has received sporadic attention in the literature, but their use in language learning programmes as a means of developing reading fluency has its advocates, among whom a leading figure is Professor Paul Nation. Chung and Nation (2006, p. 198), for example, recommended that “a speed reading course should be included in every reading class,” Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 106 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) a view echoed by Nation and Macalister (2010, p. 93), who suggested that “reading fluency activities should involve a speed reading course within a controlled vocabulary.” While the target reading speeds for different forms of reading vary, “a good careful silent reading speed is around 250 words per minute,” and this is a “reasonable [goal] for foreign and second language learners who are reading material that contains no unknown vocabulary and grammar” (Nation, 2009, p. 72, italics added). Speed reading courses, their advocates claim, can assist learners achieve target reading speeds. It is important to note, however, that Nation’s 250 wpm target is for materials where vocabulary and grammar are known, such as the texts in a speed reading course. When there are unknown elements in the text, or the reading purpose is other than general comprehension, the reading speed will be considerably lower (Cobb, 2008; Fraser, 2007). Despite the claims of speed reading advocates, it is my experience that teachers and researchers sometimes express scepticism about the benefits of speed reading. One of the reasons for this scepticism may be because relatively little research on its effect in a foreign language learning environment has been published (Bismoko & Nation, 1974; Chung & Nation, 2006; Cramer, 1975; West, 1941), and I am aware of only one study on the effect of a speed reading course in a second language learning as opposed to a foreign language learning environment (Macalister, 2008a). The existing research may be limited, but it does, however, support the use of speed reading programmes. Early studies investigated whether such programmes are best conducted in the first or the target language. West (1941) found a transfer effect from training in reading in English to first language (Bengali) reading speed and promoted the desirability of conducting speed reading courses in the first language. Bismoko and Nation (1974) and Cramer (1975) came to the same conclusion after experimental research in Indonesia and Malaysia respectively. Despite this, it is speed reading courses in the target language, English, rather than in multiple first languages that appear to have been developed (e.g., Nation & Malarcher, 2007; Quinn & Nation, 1974). Very little research has focussed on the use of such courses, although recently Chung and Nation (2006) reported on the effect of an English language speed reading course on the English language reading speed of 40 first-year university students in Korea. This course was delivered over a 9-week period, and almost all students gradually increased their reading speed, with most of the increase occurring over the first 10 texts. A substantial question arising from Chung and Nation (2006) was whether the increase claimed at the end of the course was a result of a practice effect; the students read from two to four speed reading texts a week for 9 weeks, at the end of which period they would have become “practiced” at reading and responding to the type of texts. There was no evidence that any increases were maintained, which is an important consideration if learners are to enjoy ongoing benefits from following a speed reading course. West (1941) compared reading to physical activities such as swimming, and the analogy holds for this concern about a practice effect. Just as an athlete aims to reach peak performance through a training programme, the learner may reach peak reading speed after repeated practice with a series of controlled texts but fall away from that peak when the programme ceases. It seems reasonable to suggest therefore that if apparent gains in reading speed at the end of a speed reading course are the result of a practice effect, these gains may not be maintained when reading speed is re-assessed at a later date. The hypothesis that apparent gains in reading speed will not be maintained when reading speed is re-assessed at a later date if the gains are a result of a practice effect was addressed in a study Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 107 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) in an English as a second language (ESL) context (Macalister, 2008a). Learners on a university preparation programme read the first 17 texts in a speed reading course as usual, with the remaining three texts being used as a delayed post-test several weeks after the end of the speed reading course. While most of the 29 students, as in the Chung and Nation (2006) study, increased their reading speed from the beginning to the end of the speed reading course, around one-half recorded no change or a decrease in reading speed from the end of the speed reading course to the end of the language programme, when the delayed post-test readings were delivered. While this may suggest that, at least for those students who decreased in reading speed, a practice effect was operating it was also the case that almost all the students in the study recorded an increase in reading speed from the beginning to the end of the language programme. However, it is perhaps worth noting here that the control groups in both Bismoko and Nation’s (1974) and Cramer’s (1975) studies recorded mean increases of 12% and 18% respectively in their English language reading speeds; in other words, increased reading speed may occur in the context of a language programme without the use of speed reading courses, although the gains are greater if speed reading is used. All five studies reported here support the use of speed reading programmes but questions—and, as noted above, scepticism—about their use and effectiveness remain. A critical question is whether any gains in reading speed transfer to other forms of reading. The claims for increased reading speed in Chung and Nation (2006) and Macalister (2008a) are based on changes in reading speed on the speed reading course texts, which are carefully controlled for length and lexis. Whether there is a relationship between increased reading speed on speed reading course texts and reading speed on authentic texts (i.e., texts not written for language learning purposes) is the focus of the current study. The remainder of this article, then, addresses the following question: do students who make reading speed gains as measured in words per minute over a speed reading course also make reading speed gains on another type of text? Method This study was conducted with four intact classes on a university preparation course at a New Zealand university. Most teachers within this programme were familiar with and used speed readings (particularly Millett, 2005a, 2005b), usually in the manner discussed by Millett (2008) where they form the third part of a daily fluency programme that begins with 5 minutes of writing, followed by a 2- or 3-minute speaking activity based on the writing. For this study, one teacher agreed not to use a speed reading course with her class, while the other three did. The teacher who did not use a speed reading course chose instead to incorporate extensive reading into the programme (using class sets as described in Macalister, 2008b). At the beginning of the course, all students sat a form of the Vocabulary Levels Test or VLT (Nation, 1990, 2001); this test samples various vocabulary frequency levels and provides information to guide future vocabulary learning. Information provided to students on a course document advises them that “If you get 20–24 on [a] level, you know most of these words. If you get less than this, these are the words you should learn first.” On the basis of this interpretation of their class’ results (Table 1 shows the VLT results at the 2,000, 3,000, and Academic Word List (AWL) levels for students included in the study), teachers chose to use New Zealand Speed Readings for ESL Learners, Book Two (Millett, 2005b) with their classes. As mentioned earlier, the texts in a speed reading Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 108 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) course are written within a restricted lexicon. The texts in this teacher-selected book are written with the 2,000 most frequent word families plus the AWL, word families that occur frequently across a range of texts in a corpus of written academic English (Coxhead, 2000); while the texts in the speed reading course book may have been more difficult than ideal for a few students, they were chosen because they fitted the class profile. As Table 1 suggests, strictly speaking the groups were not quite comparable, and this caveat needs to be borne in mind when considering the results. Table 1. Vocabulary Levels Test results Score (max = 24) No speed reading (n = 12) With speed reading (n = 24) 2,000-level 3,000-level AWL-level 2,000-level 3,000-level AWL-level 20–24 12 (100%) 11 (92%) 8 (67%) 21 (87.5%) 17 (71%) 10 (41%) ≤ 19 - 1 (8%) 4 (33%) 3 (12.5%) 7 (29%) 14 (59%) The three authentic texts were all taken from a long essay written by George Orwell ([1952] 2008) about his school days (see Appendix 2). As he was writing about public boys’ school life around the time of the First World War, it was likely that the topic would be unfamiliar to all the learners, and as they were written by the same person would be of comparable lexical and syntactic difficulty (cf. Gardner, 2008). The extracts were selected and, when necessary, slightly edited. Table 2 compares them in terms of length and lexical coverage offered by the 2,000 most frequent word families in the General Service List (West, 1953) and the AWL as analysed by Range (Heatley, Nation, & Coxhead, 2002).

These results are shown in Table 3, and suggest that the authentic texts chosen for use in this study were no less challenging, and in some cases much less so, than those included as course materials. The authentic texts were to be used for independent reading with a general comprehension goal, and to some extent sit between the speed reading texts used for independent reading with a fluency goal and the course materials Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 109 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) which would typically be used in-class for teacher-directed intensive reading with a language focused learning goal. Teachers were asked to use the authentic text reading in a particular way (see Appendix 1). There was a small amount of pre-reading activity to prepare the students for the reading; this was designed to orient the learners to the text and to introduce them to any potentially problematic proper nouns. There was also an explicit focus on a meaning-related activity after reading, to encourage reading for general understanding. The instructions also prepared the learners to start reading at the same time, and to be interrupted at a certain point during their reading. They were asked to mark on their text the point they had reached after 90 seconds, and then to continue reading to the end. The implementation of the study is summarised in Table 4. It is worth clarifying that the term “speed reading course” refers to the systematic use of texts from the selected speed reading course book over the first half of the 12-week language programme; the speed reading course is embedded in the language programme. Table 4. Research design summary Timing Measure Description of activity Week 1 Vocabulary Levels Test The students take this test at the beginning of the course. It is used for diagnostic purposes. Teachers decide which speed reading course book to use with their class on the basis of this test. Week 1 Speed reading course texts 1–3, and first Orwell text All students read the first of the three Orwell texts (O1). All students do the first three speed reading texts; the average of the three scores establishes each student’s initial reading speed. Weeks 2–6 Speed reading course The treatment classes continue to work through the first 17 of the 20 texts in the course book at a rate of approximately three per week. The average of the final three texts read establishes each student’s reading speed at the end of the speed reading course. Week 6 Second Orwell text All students do the second of the three Orwell texts (O2). Week 12 Speed reading course texts 18– 20, and third Orwell text All students do the final three speed reading texts; the average of these scores establishes a student’s final reading speed. All students do the last of the three Orwell texts (O3). Results Thirty-six students in the four classes completed all three authentic text readings and missed no more than one of the speed reading texts used for measurement purposes; in fact, all but six of these students completed all. Twenty-four students were from the treatment classes that used the speed reading course; all 24 recorded increases in reading speed (as measured in words per Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 110 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) minute over three speed reading texts) from the beginning to the end of the speed reading course, and (using the same measure) all showed an increase from the beginning to the end of the language programme, although just under 50% recorded no change or a decrease in reading speed from the end of the speed reading course to the end of the language programme. This was in line with the results reported by Macalister (2008a), where a similar proportion of students did not maintain their gains in reading speed. The 12 students from the comparison class that did not use a speed reading course did not show the same pattern. These students read three speed reading texts at the start of the language programme and a further three at the end. While 7 of the 12 recorded an increase in reading speed from the beginning to the end of the language programme, 5 did not. Furthermore, the size of the recorded increases for this class was smaller than those for the others. The real interest, however, lies not in the results for the speed reading texts but for the reading speeds on the three authentic texts. The immediate impression was one of a great deal of individual variation over the three texts. Seven different patterns were identified, with three being judged to be positive, three negative, and one neutral. The three positive patterns were (a) a steady increase from one reading to the next; (b) a drop from the first to the second reading, but a rise on the third reading to a faster reading rate than on the first; (c) a rise from the first to the second reading, followed by a drop on the third reading but to a faster reading rate than on the first. The three negative patterns were (a) a steady decrease from one reading to the next; (b) a drop from the first to the second reading, followed by a rise on the third reading but to a slower reading rate than on the first; (c) a rise from the first to the second reading, followed by a drop on the third reading to a slower reading rate than on the first. The neutral pattern was one where results for all three readings fell in a 10 word band. As can be seen in Table 5, only students in the comparison class showed a neutral pattern. Table 5. Patterns of change in reading speed on authentic texts (number of students and %) Pattern No speed reading (n = 12) With speed reading (n = 24) Total (n = 36) Positive Steady increase - 7 (29%) 7 Drop then rise to above start 4 (33%) - 4 Rise then drop to above start 2 (17%) 8 (33.5%) 10 Negative Steady decrease 1 (8%) 3 (12.5%) 4 Drop then rise to below start 3 (25% 3 (12.5%) 6 Rise then drop to below start - 3 (12.5%) 3 Neutral No change 2 (17%) - 2 A slightly more nuanced picture emerges by examining differences in reading speed at different points in the course (Table 6). As shown in Table 4, the first authentic text (O1) was read by students at the start of the language programme and before the speed reading course. The second authentic text (O2) was read at the end of the speed reading course. At this stage of the programme only two students (17%) in the comparison class showed an increase, whereas 16 Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 111 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) students (67%) who had completed the speed reading course showed an increase. The final authentic text (O3) was read at the end of the language programme; the column O1–O3 in Table 6 shows the recorded difference in reading speed between the first and third authentic texts.

Group mean reading speeds on authentic texts (in wpm). Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 112 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) As a final way of considering the findings, other studies on the effect of speed reading courses on reading speed have made claims for the effect based on group means (Bismoko & Nation, 1974; Cramer, 1975; Nation, 2009, p. 64, discussing Chung & Nation, 2006). Table 7 shows the mean reading speeds for the two groups of students in the current study at each authentic text reading. The changes in mean reading speeds are also shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, the two groups were reading at dramatically different rates at O1, but after the speed reading treatment there was no significant difference on reading speed. At O3, however, the two groups again diverged. This may be related to the practice effect of the speed reading course wearing off (Macalister, 2008a). Also of interest is the fact that only the students who did a speed reading course recorded mean wpm increases on the authentic texts. They appear to have reached realistic reading speeds for English language learners reading texts which contain unknown elements (Cobb, 2008; Fraser, 2007). Discussion This study showed gains for students doing a speed reading course in reading speed as measured in wpm on speed reading texts and on authentic texts. When considered alongside the results of earlier studies, a number of conclusions can be drawn. 1. Students who do a speed reading course are very likely to increase their reading speed (as measured in wpm on speed reading course texts) from the beginning to the end of the speed reading course (cf. Chung & Nation, 2006; Macalister, 2008a). 2. Students may increase their reading speed (as measured in wpm on speed reading course texts) from the beginning to the end of a language programme whether or not a speed reading course forms a component of the language programme (cf. Bismoko & Nation, 1974; Cramer, 1975). However, students who do a speed reading course tend to show greater gains in reading speed than those who do not, even if their gains from the end of the speed reading course to the end of the language programme may not be maintained at peak levels (cf. Macalister, 2008a). 3. Students who do a speed reading course are significantly more likely than those who do not do a speed reading course to read an authentic text more quickly at the end of the speed reading course than they did at the start of the speed reading course. They are also more likely to read an authentic text more quickly at the end of the language programme than they did at the start of the language programme. From a pedagogical perspective, then, these points would seem to add weight to Chung and Nation’s (2006, p. 198) suggestion that “a speed reading course should be included in every reading class”. It is likely, however, that a speed reading course may not, of itself, be sufficient to increase and maintain reading speed. The challenge for teachers is to decide how best to reinforce the reading speed gains that a speed reading course can deliver. Opportunities to read, possibly through an extensive reading programme, are needed so that learners can maintain their gains in reading speed. In other words, as the popular saying has it, “use it or lose it.” Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 113 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) Concluding remarks The study reported here was a preliminary investigation of the effect of speed reading courses on the reading speed of authentic texts, and has a number of limitations which would need to be addressed in a future study. These limitations include the small size of the sample, the lack of comparability between the two groups, and the use of only one measure of reading speed transfer. In future studies it would also be useful to include a measure for comprehension. Furthermore, this study was a quasi-experimental one, reflecting the reality of working with intact classes in an authentic learning context. As a result, not all variables of interest could be controlled and two questions that arise from this study also deserve to be the focus of further attention. The first relates to the effect of receptive vocabulary knowledge on changes in reading speed. While higher VLT scores did not necessarily equate with faster reading speeds on an individual basis, it was the case that the class without a speed reading course had higher mean VLT scores (see Table 1) and faster mean reading speeds (see Table 7) at the beginning. The question is whether the lower gains in reading speed can be attributed to the absence of a speed reading course, or whether students with this proficiency profile have less room for improvement in reading speed (although, as shown in Table 7, they have not reached target reading speeds suggested by Nation, 2009, p. 72, for careful silent reading). If it is the latter, then this has pedagogical implications as it raises the supplementary question of when speed reading courses are most effective as a teaching intervention. The second question of interest is triggered by the recognition that six of the nine students who had a speed reading course and showed a decrease in reading speed on authentic texts (Table 6) belonged to the same class. This may suggest that teacher variables played a role in the outcome, and that the identification of optimal delivery conditions for a speed reading course could be worthwhile. As part of that inquiry, the interplay between speed reading and the opportunities for reading offered by an extensive reading programme could also be considered. It would seem, therefore, that there is still more to discover about the contribution of speed reading courses to reading fluency development, and that future studies will continue to build on the work of Bismoko and Nation (1974), Chung and Nation (2006), and others.

Appendix A Instructions to Teachers for First Orwell Reading Tell the students they’re going to be reading an extract from an essay George Orwell wrote about his school days. (Feel free to ask questions along the lines of: Has anyone heard of George Orwell? etc. etc.) Explain that he was at a boarding school around the time of the First World War and write on the board the name of the school—St Cyprian’s. Before giving them the story, explain that they’re going to be asked to do 2 things. At the end, they’re going to work in pairs to re-construct the story and to consider what happened next. However, while reading, you’re going to interrupt and ask them to mark on the handout exactly where they are at that stage by drawing a line after the word they’ve just read. So they’ll need to have a pen or pencil beside them when they read. Finally, ask them to read without using dictionaries etc. Hand out the story. Ask them not to start reading till you say so. Like a test! After 90 seconds, ask them to mark on the page where they are, and to continue reading. At end, please collect text back, with names written on. Thank you! Appendix B First Orwell Reading Extract from Part I of Orwell’s “Such, Such Were the Joys” (1952), reprinted in Orwell’s (2008) Books v. Cigarettes, Penguin Books. Soon after I arrived at St Cyprian’s (not immediately, but after a week or two, just when I seemed to be settling into the routine of school life) I began wetting my bed. I was now aged eight, so that this was a reversion to a habit which I must have grown out of at least four years earlier. Nowadays, I believe, bed-wetting in such circumstances is taken for granted. It is a normal reaction in children who have been removed from their homes to a strange place. In those days, however, it was looked on as a disgusting crime which the child committed on purpose and for which the proper cure was a beating. For my part I did not need to be told it was a crime. Night after night I prayed, with a fervour never previously attained in my prayers. “Please God, do not let me wet my bed! Oh, please God, do not let me wet my bed!”, but it made remarkably little difference. Some nights the thing happened, others not. There was no volition about it, no consciousness. You did not properly speaking do the deed: you merely woke up in the morning and found that the sheets were wringing wet. Macalister: Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts 116 Reading in a Foreign Language 22(1) After the second or third offence I was warned that I should be beaten next time, but I received the warning in a curiously roundabout way. One afternoon, as we were filing out from tea, Mrs W—, the Headmaster’s wife, was sitting at the head of one of the tables, chatting with a lady of whom I knew nothing, except that she was on an afternoon’s visit to the school. She was an intimidating, masculinelooking person wearing a riding-habit, or something that I took to be a riding-habit. I was just leaving the room when Mrs W—called me back, as though to introduce me to the visitor. Mrs W—was nicknamed Flip, and I shall call her by that name, for I seldom think of her by any other. (Officially, however, she was addressed as Mum, probably a corruption of the “Ma’am” used by public schoolboys to their housemasters’ wives.) She was a stocky square-built woman with hard red cheeks, a flat top to her head, prominent brows and deep-set, suspicious eyes. Although a great deal of the time she was full of false heartiness, jollying one along with mannish slang (“Buck up, old chap!” and so forth), and even using one’s Christian name, her eyes never lost their anxious, accusing look. It was very difficult to look her in the face without feeling guilty, even at moments when one was not guilty of anything in particular. “Here is a little boy,” said Flip, indicating me to the strange lady, “who wets his bed every night. Do you know what I am going to do if you wet your bed again?” she added, turning to me. “I am going to get the Sixth Form to beat you.” The strange lady put on an air of being inexpressibly shocked, and exclaimed “I-should-think-so!” And here there occurred one of those wild, almost lunatic misunderstandings which are part of the daily experience of childhood. The Sixth Form were a group of older boys who were selected as having “character” and were empowered to beat smaller boys. I had not yet learned of their existence, and I misheard the phrase “the Sixth Form” as “Mrs Form.” I took it as referring to the strange lady—I thought, that is, that her name was Mrs Form. It was an improbable name, but a child has no judgement in such matters. I imagined, therefore, that it was she who was to be deputed to beat me. It did not strike me as strange that this job should be turned over to a casual visitor in no way connected with the school. I merely assumed that “Mrs Form” was a stern disciplinarian who enjoyed beating people (somehow her appearance seemed to bear this out) and I had an immediate terrifying vision of her arriving for the occasion in full riding kit and armed with a hunting-whip. To this day I can feel myself almost swooning with shame as I stood, a very small, round-faced boy in short corduroy knickers, before the two women. I could not speak. I felt that I should die if “Mrs Form” were to beat me. But my dominant feeling was not fear or even resentment: it was simply shame because one more person, and that a woman, had been told of my disgusting offence. A little later, I forget how, I learned that it was not after all “Mrs Form” who would do the beating. I cannot remember whether it was that very night that I wetted my bed again, but at any rate I did wet it again quite soon. Oh, the despair, the feeling of cruel injustice, after all my prayers and resolutions, at once again waking between the clammy sheets! There was no chance, of hiding what I had done. The grim statuesque matron, Margaret by name, arrived in the dormitory specially to inspect my bed. She pulled back the clothes, then drew herself up, and the dreaded words seemed to come rolling out of her like a peal of thunder: “REPORT YOURSELF to the Headmaster after breakfast!” About the Author John Macalister is Senior Lecturer in the School of Linguistics and Applied Language Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He and Paul Nation are currently cosupervising a PhD candidate who is investigating some of the questions about the effect of speed reading that are raised in this paper. Email: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>","response":"In the study, \\"Speed reading courses and their effect on reading authentic texts: A preliminary investigation,\\" by John Macalister from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, the following statistical populations, effect sizes, and other important measures or data were reported: 1. **Statistical population**: - The study involved four intact classes on a university preparation course at a New Zealand university, with a total of 36 students completing all parts of the study. The students were placed into two groups: those who participated in a speed reading course (24 students) and those who did not (12 students). 2. **Effect Sizes and Measures**: - **Reading Speed**: Measured in words per minute (wpm), reading speed was the primary variable of interest. The study reported on reading speed using three authentic texts and speed reading course texts at different points in time (beginning, middle, and end of the language program). - **Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT)**: Students were assessed at the beginning of the course to guide future vocabulary learning. The test samples various vocabulary frequency levels and is used to establish prior vocabulary knowledge. 3. **Other Important Data**: - **Group Profiles**: For example, the group without speed reading had 100% scoring 20-24 on the 2,000-level VLT, but only 67% scored 20-24 at the AWL-level. - **Patterns of Change**: Various patterns of change in reading speed on authentic texts were identified, such as steady increase, drop then rise to above start level, and rise then drop to above start level. - **Change in Reading Speed**: - Students who underwent speed reading courses were reported to have a significant increase in reading speed from the beginning to the end of the speed reading course on controlled texts. - All students, treatment and comparison groups, were likely to increase reading speed from the beginning to the end of the language program, with the speed reading group showing a larger increase. 4. **Outcomes**: - The study found evidence that students who participated in a speed reading course showed improvement in reading speeds on authentic texts, which suggests that gains in reading speed from controlled speed reading texts may transfer to other types of texts. - However, nearly half of the students who had speed reading did not maintain the gain from the end of the course to the end of the program, providing some evidence of a potential \\"practice effect\\" where gains are not always sustained. 5. **Conclusions and Implications**: - The study concluded that speed reading courses could effectively increase and potentially transfer improved reading speed to different types of texts. - The author suggests incorporating speed reading courses into the language learning curriculum and emphasizes the need for follow-up activities (such as extensive reading) to reinforce and maintain gains in reading speed. The study calls for further research to confirm the findings, and to explore variables such as the optimal timing for the intervention of speed reading courses and the potential role of teacher delivery in the outcomes. Additionally, measures of comprehension alongside speed would be valuable in future investigations to gain a more comprehensive understanding of reading fluency development."},{"prompt":"The study found evidence that students who participated in a speed reading course showed improvement in reading speeds on authentic texts, what was the size of this improvement?","response":"The study details mentioned in your provided text do not explicitly provide a numeric effect size of the improvement in reading speeds on authentic texts for students who participated in a speed reading course.

Yet, little research has aimed to see if the speed increase transfers to other types of reading and if it has any effects on other language skills. This study set out to answer these questions and examine the relationships between EFL reading speed, reading comprehension, and memory span by looking at the comprehension scores and language memory span results. It was found that the reading speed improvement in the speed reading course transferred to other types of reading and did not necessarily negatively affect comprehension. The results demonstrated that the treatment groups considerably expanded their memory span (p<.05). Strong relationships between speed increases in the speed reading course, speed improvement in other types of reading and memory span development were also found. 1 Introduction Reading fluency has a long history in first language acquisition, but has only become an area of research interest in second language learning in the last few decades. Recent studies in English as a foreign language (EFL) reading fluency have looked at methods to increase reading speed and ways to assess reading fluency. Yet questions have been raised about the optimal results of speed improvement and whether reading instructors should encourage learners to try to improve their reading rates, as an increase in reading rate may result in a decrease in reading comprehension (Carver, 1992). The objectives of this study are to determine the relationship between reading speed improvement and comprehension, and examine the effects of EFL reading speed development on language memory span. The answer to the first issue will enhance our understanding of the speed-comprehension relationship and may thus be helpful for reading instructors who are hesitating to use methods to help their learners increase their reading rate. The answer to the latter issue will add to a growing body of literature on further impacts of reading speed improvement. This paper consists of four sections. The first section gives a review of the recent research of reading speed, reading comprehension, language memory span, and speed reading courses. The second section describes the research methodology, including information about participants, materials, and procedures. The third section provides the results of reading speed improvement through the speed 6 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation reading course, speed transfer to other types of reading, and language memory span development. The last section presents discussions on the findings and implications for future practice and research. 2 Literature review 2.1 Reading speed and reading comprehension While reading speed is generally thought to be associated with reading comprehension and past research has given insight into the relationship between these aspects, there has still been much controversy on this issue. A strong relationship between reading rate and comprehension in L1 reading has been reported in previous studies (Bowey, 2005; Fuchs, Fuchs, Hosp, & Jenkins, 2001; Perfetti, Landi, & Oakhill, 2005). Specifically, Nicholson and Tan (1997) and Levy, Abello and Kysynchuk (1997) found that poor readers benefit from rapid decoding training and suggested that, in L1 children’s oral reading, speed increases facilitate comprehension (Nicholson & Tan, 1999). However, other researchers have demonstrated a weak relationship between fluency skills and reading comprehension level (Bell, 2001; Kuhn & Stahl, 2003; Schwanenflugel et al., 2006). The link between comprehension and speed in second/foreign language (L2/FL) reading has not been clearly portrayed. Past research found that speed and comprehension are not competing components in L2 performance, and that the two factors have a supporting relationship in that speed promotes accuracy in comprehension and accuracy is one of the indicators of fluency development (Alessi & Dwyer, 2008). In Chang’s (2010) study, a reading activity was integrated into the usual program for 13 weeks to improve 84 college students’ reading rates. Results indicated that the participants increased their reading speed by 25% and their comprehension level increased by 4%. This low increase is probably due to a ceiling effect in the measurement, but it shows that speed increase does not result in a drop in comprehension. Since a consensus on the association between speed and comprehension in both first language (L1) and L2/FL reading has not been established, it would be helpful to put some effort into investigating the relationship between speed and comprehension in L2/FL reading by looking at the comprehension scores on other types of reading to determine if reading speed improvement facilitates comprehension. 2.2 Memory span Past research in reading has primarily looked at working memory span, which is a common measure of short-term memory (Fortkamp, 1999; Kormos & Sáfár, 2008; Weissheimer & Mailce, 2009). While short-term memory is thought of as a passive storage buffer, working memory span is widely defined as the mental capacity available for the simultaneous processing and storage of information, and thus a more active part of the human processing system (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; Just & Carpenter, 1992). Specifically in reading, the reader’s working memory stores syntactic, semantic, pragmatic information from the preceding text for later use. Because information can be lost from working memory through decay or displacement, there is a trade-off relationship between processing and storage in reading comprehension and this can be a source of individual differences in reading comprehension (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980). Past research has found a causal link between working memory span and L1 reading ability, naming rate, and speech rate. This suggests that memory span, naming rate and speech rate are in a linear function to reading ability and good readers do better in all three tests than poor readers (Das & Mishra, 1991). Researchers also found a strong relationship between working memory span and L2 performance (Fortkamp, 1999; Harrington & Sawyer, 1992; Kormos & Sáfár, 2008; Weissheimer & Mailce, 2009). While reading research commonly uses reading span tasks and working memory span tasks to measure working memory, a few researchers have also attempted to use sentence memory span Reading Speed Improvement in a Speed Reading Course 7 tests, which is also called language memory span tests in order to predict learners’ language proficiency. Harris (1970), for example, developed a language memory test which consisted of a series of phrases or sentences of increasing length and syntactical complexity for oral repetition. He reported that the results of this sentence memory span test correlated with the results of English language proficiency tests. Roberts and Gibson (2002) utilised a sentence memory test which required the participants to listen to sentences containing one, two, three, four and five clauses and then answer questions about the sentence content. Although they found that the results of this test significantly correlated with the results of a reading span test, they suggested that memory for sentences is not necessarily a result of linguistic experience, but rather a contribution of an independent working memory component. Seung and Chapman (2004), using an auditory sentence memory span measure carried out in connection with a speaking rate test, demonstrated that language production level accounted for a substantial portion of individual differences in sentence memory span. In this study, the sentence memory span tests did not require the participants to store or remember information, while other processes were occurring. The participants only had to remember each sentence and write it down without having to engage in any other process. They could choose when to proceed with the next sentence, once they had finished. Unlike the other sentence memory span tests, the sentence memory span tests used in this study were not done orally. Instead, the participants were allowed to read the sentences appearing on the computer screen before typing them onto the computer. This was done for several reasons. First, if the tests had required the participants to listen to the sentences and then write them down, it would have been difficult to decide if a mistake was made due to faulty listening or faulty memory span, because the participants were not native speakers of English. Second, because the treatment was done in reading, it would be more relevant to let the participants read rather than listen to the sentences in the tests. Third, if the participants had been asked to repeat the sentences orally, it would have been hard to decide if a mistake was caused by faulty memory span or faulty pronunciation. 2.3 Speed reading courses There has been a growing body of literature on timed reading or speed reading as one of the methods to increase L2/FL reading speed (Chung & Nation, 2006; Fry, 1967; Hunter, 1975; Macalister, 2008, 2010; Quinn & Nation, 1974). A course of this kind usually consists of around 20 texts of equal length and difficulty level, each accompanied by comprehension questions. During the course, the students read the texts and keep a record of their reading rate and comprehension scores. Although little research has explored the effects of reading speed improvement on other languages besides English, a few studies have found that speed reading courses were effective in helping learners to increase their reading rates (Bismoko & Nation, 1972; Cramer, 1975; Chung & Nation, 2006; Macalister, 2008, 2010). Macalister (2010) found some evidence of speed increases in speed reading courses transferring to reading outside the course. In conclusion, there is evidence that during a speed reading course, L2 learners can improve their reading rate, but stronger evidence is needed on whether that improvement transfers to other types of reading and affects other language skills. This study, thus, aimed to measure the effects of speed reading courses on reading rate improvement both in and outside the courses and the effects of the speed improvement on language memory span. The research addresses the following questions: 1. Will the speed improvement in the speed reading course transfer to other types of reading? 2. Will reading speed improvement contribute to learners’ development of language memory span? 8 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation 3 Methodology 3.1 Materials The book “Asian and Pacific Speed Readings for ESL Learners” by Millett, Quinn and Nation (2007), an adapted version of Quinn and Nation (1974), was used for the speed reading course. This book contains twenty 550-word passages written at the 1000 word level. Each of the texts was accompanied by ten comprehension questions. It was shown in the pilot tests that all the texts were roughly equal in terms of difficulty level and were relevant for learners who have reached the 2nd 1000 word level. In order to make sure that the participants had reached the desired vocabulary level for the speeding reading course, they sat a vocabulary test. The test was taken from Schmitt, Schmitt and Clapham (2001). The two texts used for the pre-test and post-test were taken from graded readers at the 1000 word level but modified to contain similar numbers of total words, academic words, words at the 1000 word level, words at the 2000 word level, and off-list words. Each of the texts was accompanied by ten comprehension questions and was then put in a computer program. These texts were longer and involved different topics from the twenty texts in the course. They were read on a computer screen rather than in hard copy so that the administrator did not have to control the starting time of all the participants. The program automatically recorded the time when the participants clicked the “Next” button to see the comprehension questions. The researcher did not have to count the number of words that each participant read in one minute, as the computer program did it automatically. To determine whether speed increases in the course were accompanied by language memory span improvement, two memory span sets were utilized for the pre-test and post-test. Each memory span set consisted of 20 sentences that were written within the 1000 word level. The sentences were of increasing length and syntactical complexity. The two sets contained corresponding sentences that were equal in terms of vocabulary level, length, and grammatical difficulty. In the present experiment, the sentences were part of a computer program, which allowed the participants to read each of the sentences within a certain amount of time, and then write it from memory. Pilot testing was done on the twenty texts in the speed reading book, the vocabulary test, the pre-test and post-test texts, the memory language span sets of sentences and the language memory span computer program. Some changes were made upon the first pilot testing results and the second pilot testing showed that no texts in the speed reading book were markedly easier or more difficult than the others, the vocabulary test worked well, the pre-test and post-test texts and test instructions accompanying them were comprehensible, the sentences in the two memory span sets were equal in terms of difficulty, and the computer program worked smoothly. 3.2 Participants The study involved 116 first-year students at a university in Vietnam. They were put into four groups: two experimental groups, hereafter called Group A (31 students) and Group B (30 students), and two control groups, hereafter called Group C (26 students) and Group D (29 students). The participants in Groups A, B and C were English majors at the university. The participants in Group D were non-English majors. The following criteria were applied when choosing participants for Group D in order to equalize participants in this group with participants in the other groups: First, their age range was from 19 to 23. Second, they had been studying English for the same length of time as the other participants had. Third, their background education was similar to that of the other groups. Fourth, they did not follow the English program that the other participants did, but they followed a general English course, which lasted for the same length of time. A brief description of the treatment and variables that the four groups followed is presented in Table 1. Reading Speed Improvement in a Speed Reading Course 9 Table 1. Brief description of what the four groups followed during the experiment Group name Number of participants Speed reading course Usual English program English course at the language centre A 31 YES YES NO B 30 YES YES NO C 26 NO YES NO D 29 NO NO YES 3.3 Procedures Before the treatment started, all participants in the four groups sat the pre-test on reading other types of texts and memory span. After that, the treatment groups (Group A and Group B) followed both the speed reading course and the usual English program. The control groups did not follow the speed reading course, but one of them (Group C) followed the usual English program at the university and the other (Group D) attended an English course at a language centre. The usual English program at university and the English course at the language centre both lasted for 15 weeks. At the beginning of the speed reading course, the two treatment groups took the vocabulary test and it was shown that all the participants had reached the 2nd 1000 word level. In each of the speed reading sessions, the texts were distributed among the participants in the way that as few students as possible were reading the same passage at the same time. This was to control the possibility of different difficulty levels between the passages. The speed reading program lasted for ten weeks with two sessions per week and involved each learner choosing a passage to read, waiting for the teacher to tell them when to start, doing the reading, noting the time taken to read the passage, answering the ten multiple-choice questions without looking at the text again, marking their answers using an answer key, converting their reading time into words per minute, and entering their speed and comprehension scores onto a graph. When the speed reading course, the usual English program, and the general English course at the centre ended, the four groups sat the post-tests on reading other types of texts and memory span test. In order to eliminate the text effect, for the pre-test, half of the participants from each group read one text and the other half read the other text. For the post-tests, the administration of the texts was the reverse of that for the pre-tests. 4 Results 4.1 Speed increases in the speed reading course The participants’ speed increases were measured using four different scoring methods. Three of those methods were used by Chung and Nation (2006): The average scoring method takes the average score of the first three texts minus the average score of the last three texts; the 20th minus 1st scoring method takes the score of the 20th text minus the score of the 1st text; the extreme scoring method takes the highest score minus the lowest score. The fourth method, called the three extremes scoring method, was formulated while we were analysing the data. This method takes the average score in the best three sessions minus the average score in the worst three sessions. Similar rankings for the two treatment groups were found using the four different scoring methods. Both groups made average increases of at least 50 wpm using each method (see Table 2). The reliability of the speed improvement both groups made was reinforced by the fact that the two groups had similar average initial scores, thus demonstrating that the four scoring methods agree with each other. It was also found that most of the participants had their slowest speed in the first half and their fastest speed in the second half of the course, and that most of the participants continued to in- 10 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation crease their speed after the 10th session and many kept improving during the last five sessions (see Table 3). These facts show that the participants made a real improvement and the speed reading course was bringing about continual improvement. Table 2.

Not only was the average score for the first three texts compared with the average score for the last three texts, but also the average score of the first half of the course was compared with the average score of the second half of the course. The results, as shown in Table 4, indicate that both groups made slight increases in the average score of the last three sessions compared with the average of the first three sessions. The same trend was shown when comparing their average scores of the first half of the course with their average scores of the second half of the course. Besides, the small standard deviations indicate that comprehension was generally around the desired 7 out of 10. It can be concluded that most participants can keep their comprehension accuracy, as they increase their reading speed. This reinforces the idea that they make progress in reading speed and that speed reading courses help readers improve their speed without compromising their comprehension. Because there were ten comprehension questions for each text and they focused largely on global comprehension, a ceiling effect was operating on the scores allowing only small increases. Table 4.

Table 5. Mean speed increases and standard deviations on other types of reading for all groups Treatment groups Control groups Group A Group B Group C Group D Individual groups Mean increase 46.16 50.43 10.46 19.65 SD 27.34 24.28 29.60 27.37 Average of two treatment groups and two control groups Mean increase 48.26 25.76 15.30 SD 28.56 As can be seen from Table 5, while the control groups’ average increase was only 15 wpm, the treatment groups’ average increase was over three times bigger (48 wpm). A one way ANOVA showed that the mean scores of the four groups were significantly different, F(3,90) = 16.78, p < .001. Tukey post hoc comparisons indicated that the treatment groups A (M = 46.16, SD = 27.34) and B (M = 50.43, SD = 24.28) both had a significantly (p<0.001) higher mean improvement than the control groups C (M = 10.46, SD = 29.60) and D (M = 19.65, SD = 27.37). Since all groups started at similar speeds (see Table 6) but the treatment groups reached much higher speeds on the post-test, it can be assumed that most of the speed increases were an improvement as a result of the speed reading course not of calculation methods or unequal initial speeds. The data also showed that the participants who read Text A for the pre-test and Text B for the post-test and the participants who read them the other way round made similar average increases, thus suggesting that the difficulty of the texts themselves was not the cause of pre-test and post-test differences.

The increase group was also the one which had the biggest increase in reading speed. A comparison of the treatment groups’ and the control groups’ results shows that the treatment groups outperformed the control groups in comprehension (see Table 8). An analysis of the data at an individual level shows that only five participants among the 16 participants whose speeds decreased had a comprehension score increase and only 17 among the 100 participants whose speeds increased had a comprehension score drop. These results agree with the results drawn from the analysis at the group level. The findings suggest that the speed reading course helped the participants maintain their comprehension while increasing their reading speed. Thus, most of the participants who followed the course did not have to trade comprehension for speed. It might also be possible that there was a link between comprehension and reading speed improvement: the participants who greatly increased their speed tended to have improved their comprehension accuracy, while it was less likely that participants who only marginally increased their speeds would improve their comprehension accuracy. Table 8.

Each of the two memory span sets consisted of 20 sentences of increasing length and increasing complexity in grammar. The participants were allowed to see each of the sentences for a set time before they typed it onto the computer. There were scoring criteria to make sure the results were reliable and systematic for the 116 participants. First, the test focused on receptive language rather than productive language. That is, we aimed to see how well the readers could cope with the sentences shown to them in terms of meaning, syntax and lexis. As a result, with regard to meaning, they were supposed to repeat the exact message of the sentences involved. Regarding syntax, they were supposed to provide the grammatically correct forms of the original sentences. In terms of lexis, they were supposed to repeat the same words and spelling as in the original sentences. Generally, the errors made by the participants can be categorized into three groups: obvious spelling errors, grammatical errors and lexis errors. However, as the test was done on the computer, there were a number of errors where it was difficult to decide if they were caused by just a typing mistake or incorrect lexical knowledge and/or grammatical knowledge. Therefore, we also tried to analyze the data in other ways to compare the results between the pre-test and post-test for each individual. Table 9 summarizes the three scoring methods that were used. The three scoring methods were named the tough method, the moderate method, and the generous method. For the tough method, no errors of any sort were accepted. For the moderate method, only obvious spelling mistakes were accepted. For the generous method, obvious spelling errors, grammatical errors and lexis errors were all accepted if they did not result in a meaning change. An example of a mistake resulting in a lexical meaning change is “She thought it was very interesting to listen to the talk about her brothers” instead of “She thought it was very interesting to listen to the talk about her friends.” The generous method does not accept this mistake. An example of an error that does not result in a lexical meaning change is “Jack reads books in the library” instead of “Jack reads books at the library.” The generous method accepts this mistake.

The difference between the raw scores for the pre-test and posttest indicated the amount of improvement. A preliminary analysis of the data using the tough method (see Table 10) indicated that the two treatment groups outperformed the two control groups in terms of average increases, the number of participants making an improvement and the number of participants not making any improvement. Table 10. Increases in language memory span for all groups (tough scoring method) Group A Group B Group D Group C Increases Mean 5.46 4.80 1.72 1.39 SD (2.94) (2.68) (5.23) (4.00) No of participants with no improvement 2/31 1/30 12/29 11/26 No of participants with an improvement 29/31 29/30 17/29 15/26 No of participants with increases over 5.0 17/31 16/30 9/29 7/26 A repeated measures ANOVA was carried out on the pre-test (initial score) and post-test (final score) data. The repeated-measures factor was “time” (pre-test vs. post-test) and the betweensubjects factor was “group.” The results are shown in Table 11. Table 11. Means and standard deviations of pre-test and post-test memory span for all groups (tough scoring method) Groups Analysis of variance A B C D Group F(3,112) Time F(1,112) Interaction F(3,112) Pre-test Mean 9.48 9.20 9.65 10.00 2.96* 88.29** 8.59** SD 3.30 3.09 3.21 4.04 Posttest Mean 14.94 14.00 11.04 11.72 SD 2.56 2.84 3.19 3.08 ** p < .01, * p < .05 The results indicated that there was a general gain for all groups from pre-test to post-test, η² = .441. There was a great effect on the overall group, but it was not meaningful in the light of this research. The interaction (group x time) results showed that the memory span gains from pre-test to post-test for the two treatment groups were significantly greater than for the control groups, η² = .187. It can be clearly seen from Figure 1 that the treatment groups made significant gains in memory span, and their mean improvement was greater than the memory span gains of the control groups. 14 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation In order to determine the nature of the interaction effect, a one way ANOVA was carried out to compare the gain scores (pre-test to post-test) of the four groups. The results showed the mean scores of the four groups were significantly different, F(3, 112) = 8.59, p = .000, η² = .187. The mean gain score for Group A memory span development was 5.46 (N=31, SD = 2.94). The mean gain score for Group B speed training was 4.80 (N=30, SD = 2.68). The mean gain score for Group C was 1.39 (N=26, SD = 4.00). The mean gain score for Group D was 1.72 (N=29, SD = 5.23). Fig. 1. Estimated marginal means of memory span increases for all groups Pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons showed a significant difference between Group A and Group C (p = .001) and between Group A and Group D. (p = .002). There was also a significant difference between Group B and Group C (p = .007) and between Group B and Group D (p = .015). There was no significant difference between Groups C and D (p = 1.000). Analysis of the initial and final scores showed that in the pre-test the average scores of the treatment groups were slightly lower than the average scores of the control groups. The treatment groups’ increases were a real improvement and not the result of the lower average scores at the beginning of the treatment. Further analysis indicated that in both pre-test and post-test, none of the participants had zero or 20, and that the participants who scored higher on the pre-test tended to score higher on the post-test, but the participants with shorter memory span could also increase it to a great degree to keep up with the participants who had already had a better memory span. These results demonstrated that there were no ceiling or floor effects, and that the difference between the participants’ initial scores and final scores was real progress, not erratic behaviour. A comparison between the results by participants who had Set A and participants who had Set B in either pre-test or post-test indicated that there was no striking difference between the two groups. It can therefore be assumed that the different versions of language memory span did not distort the results. A close link between the speed increases and increases in language memory span was also found. There was a trend that the greater the memory span increase one group made, the better Reading Speed Improvement in a Speed Reading Course 15 reading speed improvement they achieved. In addition, the increases in memory span agreed very well with the increases in reading speed on other types of reading. The data indicated that the groups with better improvement in other types of reading also achieved greater increases in memory span. An examination of the individual participants in each group (see Table 12) showed that the four groups had more participants reaching the more demanding parts of the post-test. The fact that the number of participants performing well on the easier parts did not noticeably change while the number of participants succeeding on the more demanding parts markedly increased showed that the participants had more correct answers and these answers were for sentences in the more difficult parts of the test. This suggested that the increases they made were a real improvement in memory span. Table 12. Number of participants having correct answers in each part of the test for all groups Pre-test Post-test Group A Group B Group C Group D Group A Group B Group C Group D Part 1 31 30 26 29 31 30 26 29 Part 2 30 29 25 26 31 29 26 28 Part 3 24 24 21 24 31 29 23 28 Part 4 17 19 18 16 30 26 19 22 Part 5 10 12 10 15 28 25 9 17 The moderate method and the generous method were also used to count the scores gained by the participants and they produced similar results in terms of the ranking of the groups and the numbers of participants with no improvement and participants with improvement. Taken as a whole, there was evidence that the treatment groups made more meaningful improvement in language memory span than the control groups, and the speed increases in the course facilitated language memory span development. 5 Discussion 5.1 Reading speed improvement, reading comprehension in the course and speed increase transfer to other types of texts The study found that both treatment groups made increases over 50 wpm. This is a substantial improvement in reading speed and it is encouraging to reading instructors who are considering delivering a speed reading course to their learners. The results agree with Chung and Nation’s (2006) findings about speed increase in the course and were reliable for the following reasons: First, the whole groups’ results were not unduly affected by the individual results of the participants who increased their speed. Second, most of the participants had their slowest scores in the first half and highest scores in the second half of the course, and their increases followed a gradual pattern, showing that the progress occurred chronologically and their progress was caused by practice rather than some erratic behaviour or on-off effect. Third, the four scoring methods agreed with each other and produced the same ranking for the two treatment groups. Fourth, there was a relationship between the participants’ initial speeds and their final speeds. More importantly, most participants were reading with 70% comprehension accuracy and could maintain this with a slight increase as they increased their reading speed, showing that they were reading and comprehending the text rather than just looking at the words without understanding them. This also demonstrates that, in a speed reading course in EFL, reading rate can increase without affecting comprehension. The study’s findings agree with Macalister’s (2010) findings about speed increase transfer to other types of reading. It was found that both treatment groups substantially increased their speed on the texts that were not in the course and comparisons between the treatment groups and control groups were significant at the p<.05 level. There were several other findings that reinforced the 16 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation reliability of this result. First, the texts were confirmed to be equally difficult, thus producing no text effect. Second, all the groups had similar average speed on the pre-test, thus confirming that the treatment groups’ increases were not caused by their initial speed being lower than the control groups’. Third, the initial speed was related to the final speed, and the in-course increases were related to the speed increases on other types of reading. These results indicated that the participants’ increases were a real improvement rather than just some erratic or dishonest behaviour. Fourth, the participants’ speed improvement was meaningful, because most of them had their comprehension accuracy increase or kept it at the same level, as they improved their reading rates. On the question of fluency development and comprehension relationship, the study found that reading faster would not necessarily degrade comprehension and that the research participants could actually increase both reading rate and comprehension at the same time. More importantly, it was shown that the treatment groups made bigger increases in comprehension scores than the control groups. It must also be noted that a trade-off relationship between reading speed and comprehension level was found at the beginning of the treatment but not at the end of the treatment. These results corroborated the findings of a great deal of the previous work in this field (Chang, 2010; Fuchs et al., 2001; Stanovich, 2000) and reinforced the benefits of the speed reading course in that it helped the participants not only to improve their reading rates but also their comprehension. 5.2 The effects of the speed reading course on language memory span In the present study, the participants’ language memory span was assessed through the sentence memory span pre-test and post-test. Increasing reading fluency involves keeping larger stretches of language in mind while reading, so it is reasonable to expect a memory span increase. A set of criteria was established and three scoring methods were used to determine the participants’ language memory span development. An analysis was also performed on the reliability and validity of the memory span sets. The results provided strong evidence that the two sets were equal enough to be interchangeably used for both the pre-test and post-test of memory span without causing any distorting data. The experiment therefore added to a growing but still small body of literature on assessing language memory span. Although there are second language studies of working memory span (Kormos & Sáfár, 2008; Weissheimer & Mailce, 2009), there are few that use second language sentences (Harris, 1970; Lado, 1965; Service, 1998). The results indicated that the three scoring methods agreed with each other and produced the same ranking of the groups. It was found that the treatment groups outperformed the control groups. The data of the best scores, the worst scores, the most increases, the least progress, initial scores, final scores, the order of the sentences on which the participants provided correct answers, and the relationships between memory span increases and speed increases all supported the reliability of the result. First, the data indicated that there was no ceiling effect or floor effect. Second, the results of the participants who did Set A in the pre-test and Set B in the post-test were compared and it was found that there were no noticeable differences between the two categories. Third, the average initial scores demonstrated that the four groups had similar results in the pre-test, showing that their increases were not affected by their initial scores. Fourth, it was found that in the post-test, the participants could answer correctly more sentences in the more difficult parts of the test than in the pre-test. This showed that the increases made in the tests were a real improvement in memory span. Finally, yet importantly, the strong relationship between the increases in the course, the speed increases in other types of reading and the increases in memory span enhanced the idea that the memory span increases were a real improvement. Thus, it is likely that development in reading fluency facilitates development in language memory span. As the findings by Harris (1970), Roberts and Gibson (2002), and Seung and Chapman (2004) showed that a sentence memory span measure can indicate a learner’s control of language complexity, it can be then hypothesized that development in reading fluency facilitates development in language complexity. This agrees with the findings by Yuan and Ellis (2003), who claimed that complexity develops, when fluency improves. However, more research on this topic needs to be undertaken, before the Reading Speed Improvement in a Speed Reading Course 17 association between reading fluency development and language complexity development is more clearly understood. The strong link between the three aspects, speed increases in the course, speed increases on other types of reading and memory span improvement, is one of the most interesting findings of the study. The data showed that the bigger the speed increases in the course and on other types of reading, the greater the improvement in memory span. This suggests that reading speed improvement not only transfers from speed reading to other types of reading, but is also accompanied by language memory span development. Several interpretations can be made of this result. First, the strong relationship among the increases in the three aspects reinforces the reliability of the study’s results. It shows that the increases in any of these aspects were not distorted by some erratic or dishonest behaviour. Second, the trend that the participants with bigger increases in one aspect also made greater improvement in the other two aspects suggests that learners’ improvement depends on some factors that are similarly effective for any aspects of language development; thus learners who have more of those factors will improve more in any of the three aspects. Some of those factors may be high motivation, good academic skills, positive learning attitudes, and confidence. However, in order to establish this, further research is required. The experiment yielded some interesting data about language memory span and reading speed. In the first place, the same trend was found when comparing the individual participants’ initial speeds with their final speeds and when comparing the participants’ initial memory span with their final memory span. When putting all the participants in four groups together according to their initial speeds, it was found that the third best group could reach as high a speed as the second best group. Similarly, in memory span, the second best group could reach the same result as the best group and the fourth best group could reach as good a result as the third best group. These results suggest that the participants’ reading speed improvement and memory span development do not depend on their starting levels. This is very encouraging for learners who are at lower levels of reading speed and memory span as it holds that through practice in the course, they can actually keep up with other learners who were initially better. Another interesting finding to emerge from the present experiment is that there was no connection between memory span and reading speed, even though the increases in these two aspects are strongly related. That is, the increase in reading speed predicts the amount of improvement in memory span, but a participant’s reading speed does not predict their level of memory span. If we rank the participants according to their memory span, it does not agree with the ranking of their reading speeds. To generalize, it can be hypothesised that language memory span and reading speed concurrently develop, but are not a good predictor of each other. However, the relationship between reading speed and memory span is an intriguing one and further studies need to be done to explore the role of memory span in the reading process, to what extent it facilitates reading rate, if it does, and how it really affects and reflects the development of reading speed and other language aspects. 5.3 Implications The study has several implications for practice and research. In the first place, it was found that reading speed development does not necessarily happen with a trade off in comprehension. In contrast, comprehension can be maintained or improved along with reading speed improvement. The results indicated that participants who had not been trained with speed reading tended to slow down their speed, when they wanted to obtain better comprehension. As a result, their reading rate and comprehension appeared to be in a trade-off relationship. However, after being trained in speed reading, they could increase their reading speed without their comprehension declining. Many of them even improved their comprehension scores while increasing their reading rate. This finding may be helpful for teachers and learners, as it encourages learners to read faster without having to fear that they will comprehend less. For a long time, reading instructors have struggled with the learners’ low confidence about their comprehension level, which probably creates a psychological barrier in the learning process. Thus, evidence that comprehension and reading speed 18 Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation are not in a trade-off relationship may help teachers and learners to be more confident to use techniques and devices to promote reading speed. Secondly, the results demonstrated that improvement in reading rate promotes language memory span. It was found that reading speed increases and memory span increases are highly related. The greater the improvement in reading rate, the bigger the increase in memory span. On the other hand, it was surprising that memory span and reading speed are not good predictors of each other. In other words, knowing individual learners’ memory span does not help predict their reading rate and vice versa. These findings are consistent with those by Das and Mishra (1991), which indicated that good readers did better in memory span tests than poor readers, but prediction of reading rate from memory span was weak. A pedagogical implication of these findings is that syllabus designers should take advantage of fluency-oriented components, as development of speed can facilitate language memory span. It is also worth noting that further research needs to explore the relationship between memory span and reading speed in the inverse direction. In other words, future trials should assess the benefits, if there are any, of language memory span development in reading speed improvement. Finally, while the experiment attested to the strong relationship between reading speed and memory span, it could not detect any evidence that reading speed improvement facilitates language accuracy. The memory span results revealed a minimal percentage of accuracy improvement among the participants, even for the treatment groups. While it could be argued that the measuring method might not be reliable, it is still necessary that further research be done to explore this intriguing relationship. An issue that emerged from the analysis was the seemingly contradictory findings related to accuracy in the memory span tests and in the texts that were included in the speed reading course. Whereas accuracy in the memory span tests was improved, comprehension in other types of texts outside the speed reading course was more significantly enhanced. A possible explanation may be that accuracy in comprehension of other types of texts somehow relates to receptive skills, while accuracy in memory span tests is more closely related to productive skills. It was thus possible that since speed improvement is largely associated with the receptive dimension of language skills, it could more strongly enhance accuracy within the same dimension but not accuracy in the other dimension of language skills. Again, this finding provides useful information for language teachers and learners, who should be aware that, while practice in one receptive skill may reinforce other receptive skills, productive skills might not simultaneously develop. 6 Conclusion The results of the experiment have added to our understanding of the benefits of speed reading courses and made several contributions to the current literature on second language development. The evidence that speed reading courses bring various benefits to EFL learners and that comprehension and reading speed are not in a trade-off relationship may help teachers and learners to be more confident to use techniques and devices to promote reading speed. The research found that reading speed improvement is accompanied by language memory span development. In other words, development in one aspect of language knowledge may facilitate development in other aspects of language knowledge. It can be speculated that the improvement in memory span will transfer to greater complexity in L2/FL, but this would need to be examined in further studies. Even though future research is warranted to confirm some intriguing issues, the findings of the experiment do expand previous research and have noteworthy implications for language syllabus designers, language teachers and language learners, especially those who are involved in reading skill courses.","response":"The study \\"Reading Speed Improvement in a Speed Reading Course and Its Effect on Language Memory Span\\" by Thi Ngoc Yen Tran and Paul Nation investigated whether the improvement in reading speed from a speed reading course transferred to other types of reading and whether it affected other language skills such as language memory span. Below are some of the statistical populations, effect sizes, and other important data or measures from the study: 1. **Statistical Population**: - The study involved 116 first-year university students in Vietnam. There were four groups: two treatment groups (Group A with 31 students and Group B with 30 students) and two control groups (Group C with 26 students and Group D with 29 students). 2. **Effect Sizes and Measures**: - **Reading Speed**: The treatment groups made average increases of over 50 words per minute (wpm) in their reading speed after participating in the speed reading course. - **Language Memory Span**: The study used a memory span test, which involved participants rewriting sentences after seeing them for a set time. The treatment groups demonstrated a considerably expanded memory span (p<.05). - **Reading Comprehension**: Minor increases in comprehension scores were noted, suggesting that comprehension was maintained or even improved alongside increases in reading speed. - **Transfer to Other Types of Reading**: There was a significant transfer of speed improvement from the speed reading course to other types of reading, with three times greater improvement in the treatment groups compared to the control groups. 3. **Other Important Data**: - **Control Groups**: The average speed increase for control groups was 15 wpm (Group C) and 19.65 wpm (Group D), significantly lower than the treatment groups. - **Pre-test Speed**: All groups started at a similar reading speed, ensuring the speed increases noted were due to the intervention and not initial disparity. - **Vocabulary Level**: Participants had reached the 2nd 1000 word level prior to starting the speed reading course, as determined by a vocabulary test. - **Relationship Between Reading Speed and Memory Span**: A strong relationship was established; however, reading speed was not found to be a good predictor of memory span and vice versa. 4. **Conclusions and Implications**: - The study suggests that reading fluency development in the context of speed reading courses can enhance language memory span without compromising comprehension. - The benefits of the speed reading course appear multidimensional, affecting both reading speed and other related language skills. The study concludes that speed reading courses hold significant value for EFL learners and can play an instrumental role in advancing their reading fluency and related language skills. It encourages the incorporation of speed reading into language learning curricula for holistic development. Further research is needed to establish the relationships between reading speed improvements and other language skills, particularly in producing language."},{"prompt":"本科生毕业论文题为“项目式学习在高中英语写作教学中的应用研究”，根据自己的理解给项目式学习下定义","response":"项目式学习是一种基于实际项目的学习方法，它通过将学科知识与现实问题相结合，促使学生主动参与、合作实施项目，以解决真实问题为目标，培养学生的综合能力和解决问题的能力。项目式学习注重学生的主动学习和实践操作，通过课堂内外的调查研究、实际操作和合作活动等，使学生在真实情境中运用所学知识和技能，培养创造力、合作精神、批判思维等综合能力，提高学生的学习积极性和动机。项目式学习通过项目的策划、执行和总结评价，使学生了解和掌握问题解决的过程和方法，培养学生的终身学习能力。在高中英语写作教学中应用项目式学习，可以提升学生的写作能力和写作意识，培养他们的综合语言运用能力，并使写作成为一种实践性的能力，更好地满足现实需要。"},{"prompt":"如果要开题答辩，三分钟内我需要做哪些内容的陈述","response":"在三分钟内的开题答辩中，你可以包含以下内容的陈述： 1. 研究背景和问题：简要介绍高中英语写作教学的现状和问题，说明为什么选择项目式学习作为研究主题。 2. 研究目的和意义：明确本研究的目的，例如提高高中学生英语写作能力，培养他们的综合语言运用能力，并解释研究的重要性和意义。 3. 研究方法：简要描述你将采用的研究方法，例如文献综述、实地调查、问卷调查等，并解释这些方法与研究问题的适应性。 4. 研究内容和计划：概述你打算实施的项目式学习在高中英语写作教学中的应用方案，包括教学设计、项目任务和评估方式等，可以简要列举几个关键项目，并提及时间安排。 5. 预期结果和贡献：说明预期的研究结果，推测项目式学习对学生写作能力的提升效果，并指出该研究对教学实践和学术研究的贡献。 6. 研究限制和可能的挑战：指出研究可能面临的限制和挑战，例如时间和资源的限制，以及可能的教学实施困难，并提出解决方案。 7. 研究的预期步骤和进展：简要概述后续的研究步骤，包括数据收集和分析，结果解释和讨论等，说明研究计划的可行性和合理性。 注意在陈述中要简明扼要、重点突出，以确保在有限时间内能够清晰地传达研究内容和意义。"},{"prompt":"我会用到例证法、分析法和文献综述法，请具体阐述","response":"在你的开题答辩中，你可以对例证法、分析法和文献综述法进行具体阐述，如下所示： 1. 例证法：例证法是一种通过具体案例来支持和证明观点的方法。在你的研究中，你可以使用例证法来展示项目式学习在高中英语写作教学中的应用效果。你可以选择一些实际的案例，描述学生参与项目式学习后的写作表现，包括其创造性、合作精神和批判思维等方面的改善。通过具体案例的展示，你可以清楚地说明项目式学习对学生写作能力的积极影响。 2. 分析法：分析法是一种通过分析和解释数据、现象或概念来深入理解和探讨问题的方法。在你的研究中，你可以运用分析法对项目式学习在高中英语写作教学中的实施过程和效果进行分析。你可以收集和整理学生的写作作品、教学反馈等数据，并进行定性或定量分析，来评估项目式学习对学生写作能力的影响。通过分析数据，你可以得出具体的结论，证明项目式学习的有效性和可行性。 3. 文献综述法：文献综述法是一种通过梳理、分析和总结相关研究文献来获取有关问题的信息和见解的方法。在你的开题答辩中，你可以提及使用文献综述法来对项目式学习在高中英语写作教学中的应用研究进行资料搜集和分析。你可以介绍你已经查阅的相关文献，包括前人对项目式学习和高中英语写作教学的研究成果、现有的教学实践案例等。通过梳理和分析文献，你可以指出已有研究对于该问题的认识、现有的不足之处以及可能的研究空白，为你的研究提供理论支持和依据。 通过具体阐述这三种研究方法的用途和意义，可以展示你的科研思维和研究方法的合理性，以及对你的研究的可行性和独特性的把握。"},{"prompt":"اريدارسال اميل بالانجليي للضيف اذكرة بخصوص حجز الاجتماع لدينا ماذا صار به","response":"مرحبًا [اسم الضيف], أتمنى أن تكون بخير. أود أن أعلمك بأننا قد قمنا بتأكيد حجز الاجتماع لدينا. الرجاء مراجعة التفاصيل أدناه: تاريخ الاجتماع: [تاريخ الاجتماع] الوقت: [وقت الاجتماع] موقع الاجتماع: [موقع الاجتماع] أتطلع إلى رؤيتك في هذا الاجتماع. في حال كان لديك أي استفسارات أو تحتاج إلى معلومات إضافية، يرجى عدم التردد في الاتصال بي. شكرًا لك وتحياتي الحارة.

龙年（龙年）在中国文化中通常与力量、好运和智慧相关联。根据中国十二生肖，龙位列第五，是唯一的神话动物。以下是设计龙年logo的一些建议： 1. 龙形象：使用一条中国风格的龙形象作为中心元素，可能是盘曲或飞腾的形态。确保它看起来精神且有动感。 2. 多用红色和金色：在中国文化中，红色代表好运和喜庆，金色象征财富和高贵。这两种颜色用在logo设计上，会传递出吉祥和祝福的信息。 3. 包含传统装饰元素：比如云纹、火焰或水波纹样，这些都能增加设计的传统感和动感。 4. 中英文字：如果是为国际观众设计，你可以考虑在logo里包含“龙年”或“Year of the Dragon”的文字，使用对应的中国汉字和英文字母。选择一个合适的字体，强调整体设计的和谐。 5. 年份：考虑将特定的年份（例如2024年是下一个龙年）包含在设计中，这样赋予logo特定的时代意义。 6. 匠心细节：添加一些细微的元素，比如眼睛中的光芒、利爪的尖锐等，会让整个设计更富有表现力和层次感。 每个设计都应该根据具体需求和品牌的身份来调整。希望上述想法能够激发你自己设计龙年logo的灵感。如果你需要更具体的设计帮助，我建议你联系专业的图形设计师。"},{"prompt":"写一个上班族下班后自己买菜吃饭喝酒的故事","response":"张强是一位勤恳的上班族，在繁忙的都市中心工作。他的日常生活由早上的告别、挤公交、码字、会议和数字组成，充满了重复和期限。在周五的傍晚，他感受着那周末即将来临的激动心情，准备结束一周的工作。 当夕阳的最后一缕光线透过他办公室的玻璃窗，张强关掉电脑，整理好办公桌上的文件，准备离开这个属于数字和截止期的空间。他与同事道了声再见，走出忙碌的写字楼，呼吸着稍显污浊但自由的空气，他的心里既有释放的舒畅，也有一丝孑然一身的孤寂。 张强决定今晚不再点外卖，也不去那些他独自一人也能显得格外拥挤的餐馆。他决定亲自下厨，给自己来一顿简约却实在的家常菜。于是，他径直走到了附近的市场，那里的喧嚣和生活的气息立刻将他办公室的冷寂清扫而空。 市场里，摊位上摆满了各式各样的蔬菜和肉类，海鲜和干货，散发着鲜美而引人的味道。张强有选择地挑了几样自己喜欢的食材：一束翠绿的青菜、几块新鲜的鱼排、以及一些基本调味品。他享受着挑选食材的过程，那种接触真实物品的感觉让他觉得自己又回到了生活的轨道上。 回到家中，张强迫不及待地开始了他的烹饪之旅。他将青菜仔细洗净，用热水略微焯一下，保持蔬菜的清脆；他小心地将鱼排洗净，轻轻地在鱼皮上划几刀，提味又易于入味。他打开收音机，让优雅的音乐与咕嘟的油声、滋滋的煎炸声交织在一起，形成了属于自己的小小交响乐。 鱼排在锅中变得金黄而外脆内嫩，搭配上那清绿的青菜，就是一顿精心而简单的晚餐。张强在餐桌前静坐，为自己倒了一杯红酒。他轻轻地摇晃着酒杯，观察着酒液在杯中留下的曲线，品尝着属于成就和努力的果实。 这一刻，即使周围没有聊天的声音，也没有笑语和共鸣，张强却依然感到了一种从未有过的满足与宁静。他吃着自己亲手烹饪的晚餐，品着微醺的红酒，仿佛一切工作上的繁忙和紧张都化作了那缓缓升起的酒香，与美食的香味相融，平淡却充实。 故事结束时，张强看着窗外的星空，思绪飘远。这样的夜晚，可能并不富丽堂皇，却让他真切地感受到了生活的本真和简单的快乐。而这，或许就是他下班后最渴望体会到的一种生活状态。"},{"prompt":"写一个，民间传说的奇闻异事。","response":"很久以前，在中国的一个偏远山村里，流传着一个关于山神的奇闻异事。这个山村坐落在群山之中，村民多以耕种和采药为生。他们深信山中居住着一位神秘而威严的山神，名为“岳麓大仙”。岳麓大仙不仅掌管着山中的一切动植物，还能够呼风唤雨，赐予村民好收成。 传说在每年的春秋两季，岳麓大仙会选出一个心地善良的村民，赋予他（或她）通晓草药之术的能力。不过，大仙的恩赐不是随便给予的，他会先考验这个人的诚意和善心。接受考验的过程永远围绕着一条神秘的规矩：获得恩赐的人不能贪心，也不能泄露天赋的秘密，否则恩赐将化为灾难。 一年，一个名为阿源的孤儿小伙子在村边的小溪旁捡到了一块普通的石头。这块石头上刻着奇怪的符号，看上去很不寻常。阿源将石头带回家中，放在床头边的竹篮里。那晚，当他进入梦乡后，岳麓大仙的灵魂附在了那块石头上，向阿源显灵。 岳麓大仙告诉阿源，只要他保守秘密，一年内不公开使用草药之术，这门术就将永久属于他。阿源虽然只是一个普通的村民，但他由衷地感激大仙的恩赐，每次使用草药救治他人，都是在夜深人静时悄悄进行，从不张扬。一年过去了，村中有许多生病的村民和受伤的动物都奇迹般地康复了，却无人知晓是阿源所为。 但好事不长，在那一年的年底，当阿源帮助了一位骄傲的富家子弟治愈了重病后，富家子弟为了报答阿源，大张旗鼓地将这件事传遍了四方。不久之后，阿源的神秘能力也随之消失了，病患和动物不再奇迹般康复，山村人再也没有得到过类似的草药恩赐。 自那以后，村中流传着阿源的故事，同时也成为了一则警示：拥有的恩惠要好好珍惜，不可贪婪和炫耀。而岳麓大仙的传说也给村民留下了无穷的遐想，并且深信，大仙依然在保护着他们的村子，只不过以另一种方式在寂静中默默地注视着他们……"},{"prompt":"继续","response":"随着时间的流逝，阿源的事迹逐渐成为村民口中的经典故事，大家都惊叹于阿源的不幸与大仙的神秘。尽管阿源失去了来自岳麓大仙的恩赐，但他的善行和草药技术却在无形中得到了回报，因为他赢得了村民们真诚的尊重和感激。 而在村子里，每逢春秋，年长的村民们依旧会带着孩子们爬上山去，到达传说中岳麓大仙居住的山顶，虔诚地敬献上香火和祭品，求得年年有好的收成和平安健康。 某年春天，山中迎来了一位行脚僧人。他四处转悠，对所有问他来历的村民只是报以微笑，他的身上似乎有一种祥和的气息，让人觉得心安。那一年春耕的季节，僧人突然找到了阿源，用他深邃的眼神凝视着阿源，似乎能看穿他的内心。 僧人对阿源说：“你的心地纯洁，即使失去了天赋，你的善行也已经洒满这片土地。岳麓大仙的恩赐或许不再，但你深知与自然和谐共处，乐于助人的精神才是这世上最宝贵的。”说完，僧人把一串佛珠递给了阿源，并告诉他，这串佛珠将护佑他一生平安。 僧人的话深深触动了阿源，他开始意识到即使没有草药之术，他仍然能对村子做出贡献。于是他开始努力学习老一辈的知识，记下他们的经验和智慧，在日常生活中帮助村民解决实际问题。他的举动，再次赢得了村民们的尊敬与爱戴。 多年后，阿源成为了村子的智者，他的家变成了一个用于集会和讨论的地方。而那串佛珠总是挂在他的脖子上，成为了他智慧与慈悲的象征。而僧人此后也不再出现，但村民们相信他是岳麓大仙化身，而这件事也成了新一代村民们口耳相传的奇闻异事之一。 时至今日，尽管那些被草药神奇治愈的日子已经远去，村子里还是会有不定时地传来岳麓大仙显灵的传言。而更多的人，则在清晨的朝暮与晚风的低语中，感受大仙给予的另一份恩赐——生活的智慧与内心的宁静。"},{"prompt":"ترجمه کامل به فارسی: يونيسيف: لا يمكن للعالم البقاء متفرجا وأطفال غزة بين قتيل ومحروم قالت

[“‘P:옆집 묘한 남자’ 리딩 준비 중······”] 익숙한 로봇 같은 여자 음성을 끝으로 우진이 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 세상으로 빨려 들어갔다. 뒤로. 다시 강우진이 현실. 즉, ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 대본리딩장으로 돌아왔을 땐. “······” 왜인지 입을 열기가 힘든 감각이었다. 아니, 입을 열 순 있겠지만 음성을 뱉기가 어렵다. 뇌에서 지시는 내리지만 몸이 거부하고 있다. 이미 각인된 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 모든 것이 부피를 키웠기 때문이었다. ‘······처연하다.’ 잠시 눈을 감은 강우진은 혈관을 타고 번지는 지금의 감정을 소화한다. 이해하고 생각한다. ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 세상이 넓어진다. 그리고. ‘수어, 수어가 잘 보여.’ 머릿속에 수어(수화)가 가득해졌다. 이미 통달한 수어지만 반복된 리딩(경험)에 더욱이 심화된다. 더불어 강우진은 느꼈다. 얼굴 근육이 매우 유연해졌다는 것을. 목소리는 봉쇄됐지만 촉각과 후각이 예민해졌고 온몸이 깃털처럼 가볍다. 아니다. 가벼운 것이 아니라 부드럽다. 마치 몸 전체가 딱딱한 고체에서 말랑한 액체가 된 기분이었다. 당연했다, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 수어를 위해 몸을 자주 써야 했으니까. 이때였다. “안녕하세요-” 리딩의 시작이 도래함에 따라 주·조연 배우들이 모습을 드러내기 시작했다. 다들 평범하게 비즈니스적인 미소를 띠며 인사해댄다. 그러다가도. “이야- 우진씨? 반가워요. 하하, 이번 일본 쪽 쿄타로 감독님 건은 진짜 놀랐어요.” 입구 쪽 자리의 강우진에게 달라붙는다. 거의 모든 배우가 그랬다. 눈들은 죄다 웃고 있다. 허나, 속마음을 들여다보면 각양각색의 감정이 내포돼있었다. 감탄 또는 질투, 시기, 경외, 의아, 신기함, 의문, 기쁨 등등등. 그중. ‘얘가 그···강우진. 확실히 신인 재질은 아닌 듯한데, 대체 얘한테 뭐가 있기에?’ 방금 강우진과 악수한 뒤 첫 번째 자리로 이동하는 배우는 ‘의아함’이 짙었다. ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 남주 ‘송태형’역을 맡은 탑배우 정장환이었다. 모자 쓴 정장환은 키가 매우 컸다. 그리고 선이 짙어서 남자답게 생긴 비주얼. 이미지는 강우진과 흡사했다. 허나 나이는 우진보다 10살이나 많다. 정장환은 일명 ‘영화에서 안 먹히는’ 배우였다. 그런 배우가 있다. 드라마에선 빵빵 터지는데 영화만 가면 죽 쓰는. 정장환이 딱 그랬다. 그래도 드라마 판에서는 전설급으로 훨훨 나는 건 확실했다. 탑급 배우인 것도 모두 인정한다. 물론, 연기도 수준급이고. 그러니 이월선 작가가 캐스팅했겠지. 어쨌든 정장환은 대본을 펼친 뒤, 도착한 주변 배우들과 스스럼없는 대화를 하는 척하며. -슥. 강우진에게 눈길을 던졌다. 어느새 리딩장은 많은 배우들이 도착해 시끌벅적해졌지만, 우진은 처음 모습 그대로 덤덤하게 앉아 있었다. 배우들이나 관계자들에게 축하나 질문이 던져졌지만 의연함을 유지했다. 민망해한다거나 기뻐한다거나 건방진 것조차 존재치 않았다. 저걸 뭐라고 해야 할까. ‘애가 물결이 없어.’ 흔들림이 보이지 않는다. 슬슬 정장환은 심히 강우진이 궁금했다. 그가 본 강우진의 연기는 딱 두 가지였다. ‘김류진’과 ‘박대리’. 정장환 말고도 이 리딩장에 있는 모두는 비슷할 것이었다. 두 작품 모두 대박이 났고 거기서 우진이 보여준 연기는 터무니없는 건 맞다. 신인이 넘나들 사이즈가 아니다. ‘연기를 잘하는 건 알아, 그래도 권감독님이나 쿄타로 감독이 반할 정돈가?’ 그들뿐만이 아니었다. ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 이월선 작가나 송만우 PD 그리고 박은미 작가 등. 왜? 어째서 저 신인 주변엔 이리도 거물들이 부대끼는가? 정장환은 묘한 호기심이 고개를 들었다. ‘저 단단한 모습에 충격을 주면 어떻게 되려나? 그 예상치 못한 상황에 어떤 연기가 나올까.’ 이유야 간단했다. ‘얼어죽는 연애’에서 강우진이 유일하게 붙는 배우는 정장환뿐이었으니까. ‘···리딩 또는 현장에서 애드립을 받아 봤으려나?’ 우진이 맡은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’ 역은 분량은 짧지만, 연기적인 농도는 ‘얼어죽는 연애’에서 가장 짙었다. 난이도가 말도 안 되게 높다. 최소 남주인 정장환의 생각에선 그랬다. ‘수어는 보통의 언어가 아니야, 배운다고 한들 부자연스럽지 않게 해내는 건 애초에 불가능할 거고.’ 즉, 잘해야 본전이며 애매하면 무조건 욕을 들어먹을 배역. 심지어 와중에 표현까지 들어가야 했다. 대사는 없지만 없어도 대사처럼 보여야 하는 중압감. 그 빌어먹게 어려운 존재를 저 신인이 어떻게 보일 것인가? 한창 정장환의 관심이 강우진에게 쏠려 있을 때였다. -끼이. 닫혔던 유리문이 열리며, 배우들로 꽉 찬 리딩장으로 연출 PD와 이월선 작가가 들어섰다. 이월선 작가 옆엔 정장 차림의 여자도 함께였다. 곧, 배우들부터 스탭들 등이 자리서 일어났다. PD와 이월선 작가가 여유로운 인사를 뱉는다. 그러다. “우진씨, 오랜만에요.” “안녕하세요, 작가님.” 번쩍이는 귀걸이가 눈에 띄는 이월선 작가가 강우진 앞에서 멈췄다. “안 본 사이에 큰일을 냈던데?” “어쩌다 보니.” “응, 축하는 나중에 하고. 일단 여기 이분은 수어 전문가분.” 이월선 작가가 같이 온 정장 차림의 여자를 소개했다. 아마 수어 통역가인 모양. 현장에 전문가가 참관하는 건 자주 있는 일이었다. 하는 일은 오류를 확인하여 조언하는 것. 이에 강우진의 심장이 약간 두근댔다. ‘전문가- 와 씨, 약간 떨리네? 그래도 뭐 아공간은 개사기니까.’ 이어 수어 전문가와 우진의 간단한 인사. “안녕하세요.” “네, 반갑습니다. 한량 되게 재미있게 봤어요.” “감사합니다.” 그 뒤를 이월선 작가가 붙잡았다. 미소지은 그녀가 우진에게 물은 것. “박은미 작가가 그러던데요? 우진씨가 대본리딩에 참석하면 큰 변화가 있을 거라고. 그게 무슨 뜻인지 알아요?” “잘 모르겠습니다.” “그래요? 음, 뭐 직접 보면 알게 되려나?” 여기서 배우들의 고개를 갸웃했다. 그러거나 말거나 이월선 작가는 수어 전문가와 함께 책상 상석으로 움직였고. -드륵. 자리에 앉았다. 동시에 연출 PD가. “자- 그럼 리딩 시작해봅시다.” ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 대본리딩의 진행을 맡았다. 와중, 이월선 작가가 오른쪽 자리 수어 전문가에게 작게 질문했다. “강우진씨, 보니까 어때요? 그냥 인상만 보고 말씀해주셔도 돼요. 괴리가 있을까?” “···당장은 뭐라 말씀드리긴 어렵네요. 다만, 수어라는 건 손, 표정, 몸짓 전부가 합쳐진 언어거든요? 감정을 보여야 하니까. 근데 우진씨는······뭐랄까 포커페이스가 심해서 표정이 없는 느낌이 있어요.” “얼굴부터가 오류라는?” 수어 전문가가 어깨를 으쓱였다. “글쎄요. 근데 지금 상태로 하시면 문제긴 해요.” 잠시 뒤. ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 배우들 소개가 시작됐다. 여주에 이어 남주 정장환이 일어났다. “‘송태형’역을 맡은 정장환입니다, 다들 열심히 준비한 만큼 만족할 작품이 됐으면 좋겠습니다.” 쏟아지는 박수. 뒤로 계속되는 소개. 그리고. -드륵. “‘옆집 묘한 남자’ 역을 맡은 강우진입니다, 열심히 하겠습니다.” 강우진의 임팩트 있는 소개. 박수는 똑같이 나오지만 배우들의 시선엔 오묘함이 붙었다. 배우 소개로 한 바퀴를 돈 뒤엔 키스탭들의 인사가 이어졌고. “오케이, 그럼 작가님?” PD가 이월선 작가에게 할 말이 있느냐는 눈빛을 보내자, 이월선 작가가 어깨를 으쓱이며 간단히 답했다. “즐거운 리딩이 되자구요.” 말은 가볍지만 속뜻은 무거웠다. 이월선 작가는 스타작가 중에서도 리딩에 관여가 많은 작가로 유명했다. 연출과 힘을 합치는 박은미 작가와는 전혀 반대로, 이월선 작가는 본인의 의견을 배우에게 가감 없이 표출했다. 특이한 것은. “그럼, 리딩 들어가 봅시다.” -팔락, 팔락. 이월선 작가는 리딩 초반부엔 배우들에게 모든 것을 맡긴는 것. 대사가 틀려도, 부족함이 보여도, 의도와 다른 연기가 나와도, 감정이 상이 해도, 일단 리딩 초반엔 배우들이 해온 분석과 연기를 잠자코 두고 보는 편. 하지만 중반 정도가 되면 그 모습이 180도 달라진다. 비유하자면 초식동물에서 급작스레 육식동물이 된달까? 그래서 그녀의 작품 리딩 현장에선 눈물을 흘리는 신인이 많았다. 워낙 날카로운 지적이 나오니까. 디렉팅은 탑배우고 원로배우고 신인이고 모두 동일하게 박힌다. 뭐가 됐든. “S#1 암막 커튼이 쳐진 집, 대체로 검은색 톤이 많다. 이때 침대에서 송태형이 번뜩 눈을 뜬다.” PD의 지문으로 ‘얼어죽는 연애’의 리딩이 시작됐다. ‘얼어죽는 연애’는 전체적으로 보면 남주 정장환이 맡은 ‘송태형’의 성장물이었다. 나이는 30대를 넘겼고 능력도 있지만, 심각한 결벽증으로 세상 속 사람들과의 소통이 일절 없는 남자. ‘송태형’은 혼자만의 새장에 갇혔지만 그게 좋았다. 남에게 피해를 주지 않으니 나도 받을 이유는 없고, 굳이 관계가 깊지 않아도 일은 충분히 할 수 있으니 살아가는 데에 불편함은 없다. ‘송태형’은 흐트러지는 것을 극도로 역겨워했다. 그것이 사물이든 자신의 마음이든. ‘얼어죽는 연애’는 ‘어른아이’인 ‘송태형’의 성장과 사랑, 변화를 약간 가볍게 또는 무겁게 담고 있는 드라마였다. 그리고 그 ‘송태형’의 첫 변화를 주는 것이. “S#3 송태형, 손 세정제를 챙기곤 집을 나선다. 때마침 옆집에서도 문이 열리며 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’와 눈이 마주치는 송태형. 이미 몇 번은 마주친 터라 송태형은 그가 마음에 들지 않는다.” 강우진이 맡은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’였다. 곧, 정장환이 건너편 끝에 앉은 강우진을 힐끔했다. 미간을 좁힌다. “······” 미간을 찡그린 정장환은 우진과 짧은 아이컨택을 할 뿐. 마찬가지로 그를 보는 강우진 역시 대사는 없다. 아니, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 대사를 할 수 없다는 게 정확했다. 이를 아직 모르는 정장환. 아니, ‘송태형’은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 눈이 마음에 걸렸다. 저 묘한 눈빛이 ‘송태형’의 마음을 흐트러트린다. 대체 무슨 의도가 숨어 있는가? 왜 자꾸 나만 보면 저리 쳐다보는 거지? 기분이 나빠진 ‘송태형’이 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’에게 첫 마디를 뱉는다. “이봐요, 저한테 무슨 할 말이 있는 겁니까?” 그러나 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 대답하지 않는다. “······” “됐습니다. 혹시 지금 엘리베이터를 타실 겁니까? 그럼 전 잠시 후에 타죠.” “······” “긍정으로 듣겠습니다.” 대본상 ‘송태형’은 집으로 다시 들어가고, 닫힌 현관을 잠시간 보던 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 말없이 엘리베이터에 오른다. 여기서 PD가 다시 지문. “송태형, 신발장에서 투덜대며 손 세정제를 비벼댄다. 마치 기분 나쁜 것을 씻어내겠다는 듯.” 송태형의 대사. “볼 때마다 아주 기분이 더러워. 할 말이 있으면 하던가. 후- 안 되겠어. 이사를 하든지 해야지.” 그렇게 하루를 보낸 송태형은 다시금 집으로 돌아오고, 옆집의 현관문을 힐끔한 그가 조용히 도어락 비밀번호를 풀 때. -덜컥! ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 다시 등장한다. 이번에도 말은 없고 그저 송태형을 바라보기만 한다. 대본엔 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 한 손엔 비닐봉지가 들려 있다는 표현이 있다. 씬은 여기서 끝나야 했다. 송태형이 짧게 혀를 차고 집으로 휙 들어가는 것까지. 카메라, 덤덤한 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’를 클로즈업. 따라서 강우진은 저 앞에 앉은 송태형을 그저 묘하게 바라보고 있었다. ‘여기서 끝나고. 음- 다음이.’ 그런데. “이거 봐요, 당신.” ‘옆집 묘한 남자’에게 송태형이 뜬금 말을 걸었다. 대본에 없는 대사였다. “왜 자꾸 불편하게 그러는 겁니까? 말을 하든지 아니면 무시하라고요. 몇 번쨉니까 이거. 자꾸 그러면 신고합니다?” 리딩장에 있는 모두의 시선이 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’. 아니, 강우진에게 붙었다. 우진은 정장환을 보곤 있지만 속으론 명백히 당황했다. ‘엉? 뭐지. 저 대사 대본에 없는 거 아닌가? 있나? 아니 없어, 없는 대사야.’ 듣도 보도 못한 대사였으니까. 하지만 그를 제외한 리딩장의 배우들은 초연했다. ‘애드립? 하긴 장환이 형은 인물 분석할 때 대사를 만들어 오기도 하지.’ ‘이번에도 애드립 준비해 왔네, 저렇게 해서 채택된 대사도 꽤 있지 아마?’ 그리 이상한 모습은 아니었기에. 물론, 펜을 휘휘 돌리는 이월선 작가도 딱히 끼어들 마음은 없었다. ‘껄끄러움을 증폭시킨다, 뭐 그런 식으로 분석을 해왔나? 나쁘진 않네.’ 딱히 씬과 튀지 않았으니까. 뭣보다. ‘쟤가 어떻게 반응할지도 궁금하고. 뭐, 가볍게 받아치긴 할 테지만.’ 애드립을 강우진이 어떻게 받을지도 보고 싶었다. 의심은 없다. 그 ‘괴물 신인’으로 추앙받는 강우진이었다. 이런 흔한 애드립 따위에 흔들리진 않겠지. 그러나. ‘와- 미친. 이거 그냥 가는 거냐? 왜 아무도 안 끊어?’ ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는. 우진은 사고가 멈췄다. ‘잠깐잠깐. 어쩌라고 이거? 예?’ 애써 덤덤함을 얼굴에 장착한 그였지만, 저 앞에 앉은 탑배우 정장환을 보는 우진의 눈엔 어쩔 수 없이 당황이 옅게 담겼다. 이때. “어?” 이월선 작가 오른쪽의 수어 전문가가 우진의 얼굴에서 뭔가를 느꼈다. “···난감? 아니면 그 비슷한 게 보여요. 확실해, 저 눈. 대화가 어려울 때 수어 쓰는 분들이 보이는 거거든요.” 속삭임에 이월선 작가가 우진에게 시선을 맞췄다. 하지만 그녀로서는 지금의 강우진에게서 난감이나 당황을 찾을 순 없었다. 다만. ‘전문가 눈에만 보이는 게 있긴 할 거야.’ 여기에선 수어 전문가가 더 확실할 것이었다. 지금 강우진은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’를 연기하고 있으니까. 그렇기에 이월선 작가는 다른 것에 집중했다. ‘그래도······수어 전문가만 알아차릴 정도의 미세한 눈빛 표현을 할 수 있다라-’ 강우진의 연기였다. ‘급작스레 던져진 애드립이었는데 저렇게 디테일한 부분을 한순간에 끌어낸다? 역시, 기술은 탑급 저리 가라네.’ 그때 정장환의 애드립 대사가 추가로 던져졌다. “그, 그렇게 보지 마세요. 소름 돋으니까. 부탁 좀 드립니다.” “······” 하지만 우진은 여전히 무던한 표정으로 입을 열진 않았다. 그래도 변화는 있다. 약간씩 입을 뻐끔거린다는 것. 오물거리는 것과도 비슷했다. 입술이 살짝 파르르 떨리기도 한다. 수어 전문가가 바로 속삭였고. “괴뇌. 뭔가 고민하고 있어요.” 정장환이 미간을 팍 구기며 건너편 끝 강우진에게 핸드폰 꺼내는 시늉을 보인다. “그래요, 알겠어요. 왜 저한테 그러시는지 모르겠지만. 계속 그러실 것 같으니 지금 신고하겠습니다.” 여기서 뻐끔거리던 입을 뚝 멈춘 강우진. 그가 작게 고개를 꺾었다가 끄덕였다. 왜인지 말을 알아듣는 것처럼 보였다. 그러더니. -스윽. 처음으로 강우진의 양손이 움직였다. 그리 대단한 행동은 아니었다. 명료하지만 짧다. 길어야 몇 초. 이내 우진이 두 눈을 끔뻑이는 정장환을 보며 마지막 손동작을 보인다. 오른손 주먹을 말아 쥔 것. 그 주먹을 코에 닿게 붙였다. 방향은 엄지가 코 쪽. 이를 지켜본 배우들은. ‘수어다. 잘해, 당장 보기엔 전혀 부자연스럽지도 않고. 연습···아니, 잠깐만. 연습? 지금은 대본에 없는 애드립인데? 뭐지?’ 저마다 속으로 옅은 감탄 또는 의문을 뱉었다. ‘헷갈릴 정도로 부드럽게 수어를 해. 대체 얼마나 연습을 한 거야? 대단하네. 근데 저 동작은 따로 짜온 건가?’ ‘애드립을 던졌는데 수어가 바로 나와?’ 그러거나 말거나 강우진은, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 주먹을 코에 댄 채. “······” 웃었다. 지금까지와는 전혀 다른, 너무나도 화사한 웃음이었다. 이빨이 드러날 정도의, 따사로운 햇볕이 얼굴에 비췄을 때 사람이 지을 수 있는 가장 행복한 미소. 뻣뻣한 얼굴에 처음으로 표정이 드리운 순간. 이에 정장환은. ‘첫 수어, 하지만 대본엔 없는 거야.’ ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 애드립으로 나온 수어를 알 길이 없었고, ‘송태형’으로서 당장 느껴지는 것을 대사로 뱉었다. “뭐, 뭐야? 왜 웃어요? 코에 주먹을 붙이는 건-날 조롱하는 겁니까?” 허나 코에 주먹을 붙인 강우진의 웃음은 더없이 짙어졌다. 이월선 작가는 우진의 미소에 살짝 신경을 빼앗겼다가. ‘저 아이, 저렇게 환하게 웃을 수도 있었네.’ 문득, 오른쪽에 앉은 수어 전문가에게 물었고. “수어 같은데. 무슨 뜻인가요 저거.” 작게 입 벌린 수어 전문가가 질문으로 답했다. “수어 실력이 대단···하시네요, 강우진씨. 솔직히 저 정도로 예쁜 웃음이 나올 줄은. 혹시 이 씬이, 두 인물 입장의 간극을 알리는 건가요?” “그렇다고 봐도 돼요. 단절된 대화에서 오는 입장차이 같은.” 천천히 고개 끄덕인 수어 전문가가 방금 우진이 한 애드립 수어를 똑같이 따라 했다. 끝은 역시나 주먹을 코에 붙이는 것. 물론, 강우진이 보인 것보단 작은 몸짓이었다. “이 수어에서 마지막, 주먹을 코에 붙이는 부분이 ‘좋다’거든요. 얼마나 짙게 웃는지에 따라 기분을 나타낼 수 있겠죠. 방금 우진씨는 정말 예쁘게 웃으셨죠? 저 수어의 전체 뜻은.” 이어 수어 전문가가 뜻을 읊었다. “‘난 당신이 좋다’ 였어요.” < 출국 (1) > 끝","response":"< Departure (1) > The reading session for \\"Freezing Love.\\" Despite the dozens of people gathered in the reading room, including actors, staff, officials, and reporters, the reading room was generally quiet. \\"......\\" \\"......\\" The actors who arrived early looked over their scripts, while the staff and officials went about their work. The reporters looked down at their phones. However, their commonality was this: -Swish. Pretending not to, they were glancing at the rookie actor who had arrived a few minutes earlier. While looking at their scripts or phones, they sneakily rolled their eyes. It was Kang Woo-jin, sitting almost at the end of the 'D'-shaped table. -[The Mysterious Man Next Door Role / Mr. Kang Woo-jin] His role was close to a minor or supporting role, so his seat was at the back. Anyway, since the greetings were already over, Woo-jin, who had taken his seat, looked down at his script with an indifferent face. He gave off the impression that he didn't care about his surroundings. Soon, the actors. \\"Woo-jin seems really serious, like his personality. I've heard rumors, but he's more cynical than I imagined.\\" \\"That's what I'm saying. Seeing him greet everyone earlier, he doesn't seem arrogant, right? Is he usually a bit shy?\\" \\"He's definitely the type that's hard to get close to.\\" \\"But maybe because he's been showing blockbuster-level moves since he was a rookie? I don't feel any nervousness at all?\\" \\"That makes sense. He's turned everything upside down from Korea to Japan, so why would he be nervous in a reading room like this?\\" The murmurs of the reporters spread. \\"He's calm, that guy. As if he's dropped nuclear bombs in Korea and Japan.\\" \\"It's strange. Just looking at his aura, he's like a top-class veteran, it's the first time I've seen a rookie like that.\\" \\"Everything related to him is usually a first. He's so calm that we couldn't even get an interview. It's a bit hard to approach him, you know? Normally, a rookie should have some softness, but he's too rigid, or is it just me?\\" \\"Me too. Really, is he different from ordinary rookies? Look at him, as soon as he arrives, he starts reading the script with a straight face.\\" \\"That Kwon Ki-taek director also crosses his path, so why would he be nervous about a reading of this size?\\" \\"Eh? Look, isn't this also the scene of writer Lee Wol-sun?\\" \\"No, that's what I mean.\\" On the other hand, Kang Woo-jin was currently engaged in a battle with the sound of his own heart. \\"Ah, really. It's hard to adapt to this silent atmosphere. Everyone's glancing is obvious, ah forget it. Just ignore it.\\" He felt more awkward than nervous. There was really not a single person he knew in this reading room. Thinking about it, this was the first time Woo-jin had been in a script reading room without anyone he knew. Even Choi Sung-gun, who he was somewhat close to, wasn't there, nor was writer Lee Wol-sun visible. \\"Well, maybe it's more comfortable without writer Lee Wol-sun.\\" He felt suffocated. Perhaps that's why Kang Woo-jin's \\"concept\\" became more pronounced. His poker face intensified. Then, perhaps to find some mental stability. -Thump! Kang Woo-jin poked the black square attached to the script of episode 1 of \\"Freezing Love.\\" Immediately, Woo-jin entered an endlessly dark void. It was then that he let out a sigh of relief mixed with comfort. \\"Phew, I can live. Let's rest here for a bit, the atmosphere in the reading room is so stuffy.\\" Kang Woo-jin stretched. As time passed, he moved in front of the neatly arranged white squares. The reading was just around the corner, and he intended to experience the reading (practice) just before. Naturally, he chose \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door.\\" It was not an ordinary role. It needed to be even more distinct, so repeating the reading (practice) was a natural condition. Then. -Swish. [\\"Preparing for 'P: The Mysterious Man Next Door' reading...\\"] With the familiar robotic female voice ending, Woo-jin was sucked into the world of \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door.\\" Back to reality. When Kang Woo-jin returned to the script reading room of \\"Freezing Love,\\" \\"......\\" For some reason, it was hard to open his mouth. Well, he could open it, but it was difficult to utter a sound. His brain was giving orders, but his body was refusing. Everything about \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door\\" had grown in volume. \\"......How poignant.\\" Kang Woo-jin briefly closed his eyes and digested the emotions spreading through his veins. He understood and thought about it. The world of \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door\\" expanded. And. \\"I can see the sign language clearly.\\" Sign language (signing) filled his mind. Although he had already mastered it, it deepened with repeated reading (experience). Moreover, Kang Woo-jin felt. His facial muscles had become very flexible. His voice was blocked, but his sense of touch and smell became sharper, and his whole body felt as light as a feather. No, not light, but smooth. It was as if his entire body had transformed from a hard solid to a soft liquid. It was natural, as \\"The Mysterious Man Next Door\\" had to use his body frequently for sign language. It was then. \\"Hello-\\" With the arrival of the reading, the main and supporting actors began to appear. They all greeted with a business-like smile. But then. \\"Wow- Woo-jin? Nice to meet you. Haha, I was really surprised by the recent incident with Director Kyotaro in Japan.\\" They flocked to Kang Woo-jin, who was sitting near the entrance. Almost all the actors did. Their eyes were all smiling. However, if you looked into their hearts, they contained a variety of emotions: admiration, jealousy, envy, awe, curiosity, amazement, doubt, joy, and so on. Among them. 'That's Kang Woo-jin... He doesn't seem like rookie material, but what does he have that attracts all these big names?' The actor who had just shaken hands with Kang Woo-jin and moved to the first seat was filled with 'curiosity.' He was the top actor Jung Jang-hwan, who played the male lead 'Song Tae-hyung' in \\"Freezing Love.\\" Wearing a hat, Jung Jang-hwan was very tall. He had a masculine visual with deep lines. His image was similar to Kang Woo-jin's. However, he was 10 years older than Woo-jin. Jung Jang-hwan was known as an actor who 'doesn't do well in movies.' There are such actors. They explode in popularity in dramas, but as soon as they do movies, they flop. Jung Jang-hwan was exactly like that. Still, in the drama industry, he was flying high as a legendary figure. It was certain that he was a top actor. Of course, his acting was also top-notch. That's probably why writer Lee Wol-sun cast him. Anyway, after opening the script, Jung Jang-hwan pretended to have a casual conversation with the surrounding actors who had arrived. -Swish. He glanced at Kang Woo-jin. By now, the reading room was bustling with many actors, but Woo-jin was still sitting calmly as he did at the beginning. Although congratulations and questions were thrown at the actors and officials, he maintained his composure. There was no embarrassment, joy, or arrogance. What should we call this? 'The kid has no ripples.' There was no sign of being shaken. Gradually, Jung Jang-hwan became very curious about Kang Woo-jin. The only performances of Kang Woo-jin he had seen were two roles: 'Kim Ryu-jin' and 'Assistant Manager Park.' Like Jung Jang-hwan, everyone in this reading room would probably feel the same. Both works were hits, and the acting Woo-jin showed there was absurd. It wasn't the size a rookie could handle. 'I know he can act, but would directors like Kwon or Kyotaro be captivated by that?' It wasn't just them. Why were such big names flocking around this rookie? Writer Lee Wol-sun, PD Song Man-woo, and writer Park Eun-mi of \\"Freezing Love.\\" Why? Why are there so many heavyweights around this rookie? Jung Jang-hwan felt a strange curiosity rising. 'What would happen if I shocked that solid appearance? What kind of acting would come out in that unexpected situation?' The reason was simple. In \\"Freezing Love,\\" the only actor Kang Woo-jin was attached to was Jung Jang-hwan. '...Has he ever received ad-libs during a reading or on set?' The role Woo-jin was playing, 'The Mysterious Man Next Door,' was short in screen time, but the acting density was the thickest in \\"Freezing Love.\\" The difficulty was ridiculously high. At least that's what Jung Jang-hwan, the male lead, thought. 'Sign language isn't an ordinary language, it's impossible to perform it naturally even if you learn it.' In other words, if he did well, he would break even, and if it was ambiguous, he would definitely be criticized. Moreover, he had to include expressions. There were no lines, but it had to seem like there were lines, the pressure of that damned difficult role. How would that rookie, who was being hailed as a 'monster rookie,' show it? While Jung Jang-hwan's interest was focused on Kang Woo-jin, it happened. -Creak. The glass door that had been closed opened, and the director and writer Lee Wol-sun entered the reading room, which was packed with actors. Next to writer Lee Wol-sun was a woman in a suit. Soon, everyone from the actors to the staff stood up. The director and writer Lee Wol-sun gave a leisurely greeting. Then. \\"Woo-jin, it's been a while.\\" \\"Hello, writer.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun, with her sparkling earrings, stopped in front of Kang Woo-jin. \\"You've done something big since we last met?\\" \\"It just happened.\\" \\"Yes, congratulations later. First, this person here is a sign language expert.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun introduced the woman in the suit who came with her. She was probably a sign language interpreter. It was common for experts to observe on set. Their job was to check for errors and provide advice. At this, Kang Woo-jin's heart fluttered slightly. 'An expert- wow, I'm a bit nervous? But still, the void is a cheat.' Then a brief greeting between the sign language expert and Woo-jin. \\"Hello.\\" \\"Hello, I really enjoyed watching 'Hanryang.'\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun then caught up with him. She asked Woo-jin with a smile. \\"Writer Park Eun-mi said that if Woo-jin attends the script reading, there will be a big change. Do you know what she means?\\" \\"I'm not sure.\\" \\"Is that so? Well, I guess I'll find out by watching.\\" The actors tilted their heads at this. Regardless, writer Lee Wol-sun moved to the top seat of the table with the sign language expert. -Thud. She sat down. At the same time, the director said. \\"Alright, let's start the reading.\\" He was in charge of the reading for \\"Freezing Love.\\" Meanwhile, writer Lee Wol-sun asked the sign language expert on her right in a low voice. \\"What do you think of Kang Woo-jin? You can just tell me your impression. Is there a discrepancy?\\" \\"···It's hard to say right now. But sign language is a language that combines hands, expressions, and gestures, right? You have to show emotions. But Woo-jin... he seems to have a poker face, so it feels like he has no expression.\\" \\"His face is already an error?\\" The sign language expert shrugged. \\"I don't know. But if he continues like this, there will be a problem.\\" Shortly after. The introduction of the actors of \\"Freezing Love\\" began. Following the female lead, Jung Jang-hwan stood up. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, playing 'Song Tae-hyung.' I hope it will be a satisfying work as we all prepared hard.\\" Applause poured out. The introductions continued, and then. -Thud. \\"I'm Kang Woo-jin, playing 'The Mysterious Man Next Door.' I will do my best.\\" Kang Woo-jin's impactful introduction. The applause was the same, but the actors' gazes were filled with mystery. After a round of actor introductions, the key staff greeted. \\"Okay, writer?\\" The director looked at writer Lee Wol-sun to see if she had anything to say, and she shrugged her shoulders and replied briefly. \\"Let's have a fun reading.\\" The words were light, but the meaning was heavy. Writer Lee Wol-sun was famous among star writers for being heavily involved in readings. Unlike writer Park Eun-mi, who joined forces with the director, writer Lee Wol-sun expressed her opinions to the actors without reservation. The peculiar thing was. \\"Then, let's get into the reading.\\" -Flap, flap. Writer Lee Wol-sun left everything to the actors at the beginning of the reading. Even if the lines were wrong, if there were shortcomings, if the acting was different from the intention, if the emotions were different, she quietly watched the actors' analysis and performance at the beginning of the reading. But around the middle, her demeanor changed 180 degrees. If we were to make an analogy, would it be like a herbivore suddenly becoming a carnivore? That's why in her work's reading sessions, many rookies shed tears. The sharp criticism was the reason. Directing hit everyone equally, whether they were top actors, veteran actors, or rookies. Whatever it was. \\"S#1 A house with blackout curtains, mostly black tones. At this time, Song Tae-hyung wakes up in bed with a start.\\" The reading of \\"Freezing Love\\" began with the director's narration. \\"Freezing Love\\" was essentially a coming-of-age story of the male lead 'Song Tae-hyung,' played by Jung Jang-hwan. He was over 30, capable, but with a serious case of mysophobia, he had no communication with the people in the world. 'Song Tae-hyung' was trapped in his own cage, but he liked it. He didn't harm others, so there was no reason to be harmed, and he could work sufficiently without deep relationships, so there was no inconvenience in living. 'Song Tae-hyung' was extremely disgusted by anything that was disordered. Whether it was objects or his own heart. \\"Freezing Love\\" was a drama that lightly or heavily contained the growth, love, and change of 'Song Tae-hyung,' who was like an 'adult child.' And the first change for 'Song Tae-hyung' was. \\"S#3 Song Tae-hyung, carrying a hand sanitizer, leaves the house. At the same time, the door of the next house opens, and 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' and Song Tae-hyung's eyes meet. Having met a few times already, Song Tae-hyung doesn't like him.\\" It was Kang Woo-jin's role, 'The Mysterious Man Next Door.' Soon, Jung Jang-hwan glanced at Kang Woo-jin sitting across from him. He furrowed his brow. \\"......\\" Jung Jang-hwan, with a furrowed brow, made brief eye contact with Woo-jin. Similarly, Kang Woo-jin, who was looking at him, also had no lines. No, it was more accurate to say that 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' couldn't speak. Jung Jang-hwan, or rather 'Song Tae-hyung,' was bothered by 'The Mysterious Man Next Door's' eyes. That mysterious gaze disturbed 'Song Tae-hyung's' heart. What was hidden in it? Why does he keep looking at me like that? Annoyed, 'Song Tae-hyung' speaks to 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' for the first time. \\"Excuse me, do you have something to say to me?\\" But 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' does not answer. \\"......\\" \\"Fine. Are you going to take the elevator now? Then I'll take it later.\\" \\"......\\" \\"I'll take that as a yes.\\" In the script, 'Song Tae-hyung' goes back into the house, and 'The Mysterious Man Next Door,' who has been looking at the closed door for a while, silently gets on the elevator. Here, the director narrates again. \\"Song Tae-hyung, grumbling at the shoe cabinet, rubs his hand sanitizer. As if trying to wash away something unpleasant.\\" Song Tae-hyung's line. \\"Every time I see him, I feel filthy. If you have something to say, say it. Ugh- I can't stand it. I should move or something.\\" After spending the day, Song Tae-hyung returns home and glances at the front door of the next house. As he quietly unlocks the door with the password. -Thunk! 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' appears again. Again, there are no words, and he just looks at Song Tae-hyung. The script says that 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' is holding a plastic bag in one hand. The scene should end here. Song Tae-hyung briefly clicks his tongue and enters the house. Camera, a calm 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' close-up. Therefore, Kang Woo-jin was just looking at Song Tae-hyung sitting in front of him with a mysterious gaze. 'It ends here. Um- what's next.' But then. \\"Look at this, you.\\" 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' is suddenly addressed by Song Tae-hyung. It was a line not in the script. \\"Why do you keep making me uncomfortable? Say something or ignore me. How many times is this? If you keep doing this, I'll report you.\\" Everyone's gaze in the reading room was on 'The Mysterious Man Next Door.' No, on Kang Woo-jin. Woo-jin was looking at Jung Jang-hwan, but inside, he was clearly flustered. 'Huh? What's this. Isn't that line not in the script? Is it there? No, it's not in the script.' It was a line he had never heard or seen before. However, the actors in the reading room remained calm. 'Ad-lib? Well, Jang-hwan hyung does create lines when analyzing characters.' 'It's prepared ad-libs, and there are quite a few that have been adopted, right?' It wasn't a strange sight. Of course, writer Lee Wol-sun, who was twirling her pen, had no intention of intervening. 'It amplifies the discomfort, did he"},{"prompt":"continue","response":"I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems there might have been a misunderstanding.

어쩌지? 심장이 뛰기 시작하는 강우진. 그러다 문득. ‘······어. 그렇지. 나 대사가 없잖아?’ 치솟는 긴장감에 멍했던 머리가 약간 돌기 시작했다. 생각해보니 우진이 맡은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 대사가 없었다. 정확하게는 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 말을 못 했다. 즉, 굳이 ‘말’을 하지 않아도 됐다. 어라? 이러면 해볼 만하지 않나? 그래도 위기가 깨끗하게 사라진 건 아니었다. 애초 ‘연기’라는 게 대사만 있는 건 또 아니니까. 거기다 수어는. ‘손, 표정, 몸짓이 평소보다는 더 강해야 하고.’ 말이 없는 대신 나머지 부분들이 극대화돼야 했다. 즉, 이 순간 그는 아공간의 힘이 아닌, 수어를 습득한 ‘강우진’ 본연의 모습으로 애드립을 받아쳐야 했다. 재밌는 것은. ‘왠지- 음, 뭐라 딱 정의할 순 없는데. 왠지 될 것 같은데? 응, 뭔가 할 수 있을 것 같아.’ 막상 머릿속의 생각이 정리되니 강우진에겐 묘한 자신감이 차올랐다. 저 탑배우 정장환의 애드립을 소화할 수 있을 것 같다. 허세? 아니면 감각이 무뎌져서? 객기? 모르겠다. 아는 건 개뿔 없지만 우진은 움직였다. -스윽. 일단, 강우진은 건너편 첫 자리의 정장환과 눈을 맞췄다. 표정관리. 그다음이 수어로서 어떤 대사를 칠 것인가를 생각했다. 답은 생각보다 금방 나왔다. ‘반전, 아무래도 통수를 치는 대사가 좋겠지?’ ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 결과적으론 정장환이 맡은 ‘송태형’에게 첫 변화를 주는 인물. 그러니 현 상황에서 ‘송태형’의 말문을 막히게 하는 애드립이 알맞다. 지금 송태형은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 실체를 모르고 있다. 감정도 그닥 좋지 못하다. 곧, 강우진이 천천히 손을 올렸다. 대사는 얼추 결정한 참이었다. 수어는 아공간의 은혜 덕분에 완벽할 것. 남은 것은 표정 연기와 몸짓. 이내 우진은 송태형에게 애드립을 던졌다. 그의 마지막 수어 동작은 오므린 주먹을 코에 붙이는 것. ‘난 당신이 좋다.’ 표정은? 그래, 웃자. ‘좋다’라는 수어는 웃어야 명확한 감정이 살아나는 동작이었다. 우진은 입꼬리를 서서히 올렸다. 어떤 것을 생각할까? 첫 취업? 아공간이 생겼을 때? 홍혜연을 처음 만났을 무렵? 한량의 촬영이 끝나는 날? 내 애마? 첫 키스씬? 무슨 기억이 됐든 강우진은 세상 행복한 미소를 지을 수 있었다. 연기라는 뿌리가 밑바탕이지만 가히 오류를 찾을 수 없는 웃음. 지금 그의 표정과 표현엔 문제점을 찾을 수 없었다. 그만큼 완벽했다. 그랬다, 강우진은 지금 ‘연기’를 하고 있었다. 아공간의 힘이 보태지지 않은, 강우진 스스로 해낸 첫 연기라 봐도 무방했다. 됐다. 이게 되네? 근데 어떻게 될 수 있었지? 우진은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’의 애드립 연기를 보이면서도 과정을 생각해 봤다. 하지만 워낙 정신없이 보인 터라 잘 기억이 안 났다. ‘컨셉질을 너무 오랫동안 해와서? 아니면 아공간을 통해 습득한 배역들이 쌓여서?’ 우연일 가능성이 제일 컸다. 당장 답을 내리기엔 무리가 있다. 뭐, 어느 쪽이 됐든 나도 조금은 성장한 건가? 물론, 아직 아공간이 없다면 배우로 살긴 무리였다. 소시민 알맹이의 강우진에겐 경험도 턱없이 부족하다. 권기택 감독이나 쿄타로 감독 등 거장의 작품에서 연기하는 것도 불가능했다. 그래도. ‘확실히 전이랑은 좀 달라진 걸지도.’ 몇 달 전인, ‘프로파일러 한량’ 때의 강우진과 지금은 같다고 보기 힘들었다. 실수나 우연으로 보인 애드립이 아닌, 자의적으로 애드립을 보였고 그 급작스레 나온 연기는. ‘잘하네, 표정이 휙휙 바뀌는 건 좀 소름인데?’ ‘나도 수어는 개뿔 모른다만, 어색한 감은 없어. 자연스러운 게 계속해오던 느낌도 나고. 얼마나 연습한 거야 대체?’ ‘저 웃음. 클로즈업으로 바싹 당기고 밑에 음향 깔고 필터좀 추가하면, 그냥 영화 한 컷 뚝딱이겠네.’ ‘괜히 괴물 신인, 괴물 신인 난리 치는 게 아니었어. 연기 기깔난다, 진짜.’ 모인 배우들에게 거대한 긴장감을 불어 넣었다. ‘······분량이 짧은 조·단역, 혼자만 난이도 높은 수어 연기, 파급력이야 오진다만 어쨌든 신인, 연기 대충 했다간 바로 티 나고 욕 처먹는다. 무조건.’ 강우진의 존재 자체가 배우들에게 위기로 다가왔으니까. 특히, 우진과 유일하게 붙는 정장환이 몇 배는 심했다. ‘호기심이고 나발이고. 내 코가 석 자였어, 저런 놈이랑 같은 씬에서 비비려면······잠깐만. 내 대사. 나 다음 대사가 뭐였지?’ 그리고 지금, 리딩장 전체를 훑던 이월선 작가는 알아차렸다. ‘아하, 그래 이거구나. 이 분위기.’ 왜 박은미 작가가 강우진을 무조건 리딩에 포함해야 한다고 말했는지 말이다. 방금 전체 배우들의 의지가 변했다. 자세와 태도가 고쳐졌다. 표정에 진중함이 가득했다. ‘비교당할 순 없는 거야.’ 저 조·단역에게, 아무렇지도 않게 수어를 해대는 신인과 비교 선상에 올랐다간 삽시간에 단두대에 오를 테니. ‘그야말로 씬스틸러가 따로 없네.’ 이월선 작가는 우진을 보며 미소를 지었고. ‘어떤 역, 무슨 작품이든 존재감을 과시하는 것. 저런 게 진짜 탑이지.’ 오른쪽 자리 수어 전문가에게 작게 물었다. “우진씨 수어, 보시기에 어때요? 전문가의 눈으로만 평가해주세요.” “방금 말씀드렸다시피 대단하세요. 흠잡을 데가 없어요. 제가 연기는 잘 몰라서, 처음 우진씨를 봤을 땐 무던한 표정이 좀 걱정이었는데- 연기 시작하시니까 180도 달라지시네요.” 그건 이월선 작가 역시 절절히 느끼고 있었고, 수어 전문가가 그녀와 눈을 맞췄다. 약간 흥분했다. “아까 난감함, 고뇌가 서린 눈빛 보셨죠? 거기에 우진씨 몸동작도 상당히 부드러워요. 손동작에 따라 표정도 다채롭고. 감정이 바로바로 느껴질 정도예요. 저보다 수어를 잘하시는 것 같은데요?” 평가를 들은 이월선 작가는 여전히 연기 중인 끝쪽 자리 우진에게 시선을 맞췄다. 눈빛에 오묘함이 실렸다. ‘······쟤 뭐지? 수어 전문가가 끝없이 극찬할 정도의 수어를 대체 언제.’ 뭐랄까, 강우진은 작품 연출자나 작가가 원하는 조건을 늘 가지고 있는 느낌이었다. 문제는 그것들을 습득하는 게 거의 극악의 난이도라는 것. ‘딱히 습득에 목숨을 거는 모양새도 아니야. 그냥 일상처럼 툭툭.’ 이어 이월선 작가가 다시금 수어 전문가에게 고개를 돌렸다. “만약, 방금의 씬을 시청자들이 본다면 어떨까요.” “제가 순수하게 시청자라면 우진씨의 수어 실력에 너무 놀라서 충격, 그다음은 고마울 것 같아요. 짧은 역임에도 대단히 노력한 걸 아니까.” “그래요. 짧죠, 그것도 상당히. 그럼에도 저런 임팩트.” 당연하겠지, 더불어 이월선 작가는 일반 시청자들의 마음도 추측했다. ‘매 작품마다 형형색색으로 바뀌는 우진씨의 마스크에 혀를 내두를 거야.’ 아니, 박대리에서 갑자기 수어를? 따위의 그림이 아닐까. 거기다 강우진은 이 ‘얼어죽는 연애’ 말고도 예정된 작품이 많았다. 스타작가 이월선 작가는 팔뚝에 약간 소름이 돋았다. ‘쟤가 활개 치기엔 국내는 좁아, 일본으로 무대가 넓혀진 건 당연한 수순이었네.’ 배역의 노출도가 몇 초든 몇 시간이든, 저 괴물 신인은 늘 최고의 조건으로 비칠 것이며 시청자를 현혹할 테니까. 그리고. ‘천의 얼굴.’ 배우로서 연기의 스펙트럼을 가늠할 수 없다는 것. 뒤로 이월선 작가는. -스윽. 몸을 왼쪽으로 움직여 연출 PD에게 속삭였다. 그러자 PD가 작게 헛기침하며. “크흠! 잠시만요.” 진행되던 리딩을 끊었다. 덕분에 강우진을 포함한 수십 배우들부터 스탭들 등의 시선 모두가 집중됐다. 허나 PD는 이월선 작가를 보며 집중을 토스했다. 곧, 펜을 휘휘 돌리던 이월선 작가가 입을 열었다. 표정은 다소 딱딱하다. “직접 경험하신 배우님도, 소문으로 듣기만 한 분들도 계실 텐데. 나는 리딩 초반은 그냥 보는 편이에요. 배우들이 어떻게 내 대본을 분석해왔나 궁금해서. 애드립도 뭐 오케이.” 읊조리던 그녀가 바로 지척에 앉은 탑배우 정장환과 눈을 맞췄다. “장환씨.” “···아, 예 작가님.” “방금, 상황에 따른 애드립은 나쁘지 않았어요. 분석도 이해되고.” 차분히 읊조리는 이월선 작가의 디렉팅은 차분하지만 무겁다. 다분히 압박이 느껴질 정도였다. “다만, 호기심은 이해하겠는데 지금의 애드립은 선배답지 않은데요?” “······” “방금 그거 진짜 ‘송태형’으로서 나온 대사야? 난 배우 정장환이 뱉은 실험같이 들렸는데.” 리딩장이 한없이 고요해진다. 요상해진 분위기에 우진은 일단. ‘뭐지, 갑자기 혼나는 분위기?’ 근엄한 표정을 유지했다. 이를 모르던 이월선 작가가 눈은 정장환을 손짓은 우진을 가리켰다. “‘송태형’으로서가 아니라, 장환씨의 순전한 호기심으로 나온 애드립이 아니냐고 물은 거예요.” 올곧은 팩트가 정장환의 귓가에 꽂혔다. 금세 인정하는 투로 읊조리는 정장환. “죄송···합니다, 제가 좀 오바했습니다.” “그래요. 한참 선배면서 왜 줄타기를 해?” 여기서 이월선 작가가. “다들 들어요, 우진씨는 거의 봉사 수준으로 이 작품에 참여한 거예요. 리딩도 솔직히 안 와도 되는데 와준 거고. 이해는 해. 파악하기엔 우진씨 분량이 짧고. 궁금도 하겠지. 대체 어느 정도기에 국내 연예계를 뒤집나- 싶잖아?” 전체 배우들에게 나지막이 말했다. “그래도 적당히들 해요, 적당히. 배우로서의 호기심이 독기로 바뀌는 건 좋아요. 근데 그게 질투 시샘 뭐 그런 거로 가면 별로야.” 이쯤 턱을 슬슬 긁던 정장환이 좀 전의 자신을 되돌아봤다. ‘궁금함과 동시에 질투가 있었어.’ 강우진의 연기를 길게 보고 싶은 마음과 함께 악의적인 부분도 섞였다. 이를 알아챈 정장환이 건너편 끝쪽의 강우진에게 순수하게 사과했다. “미안해요, 우진씨. 내가 좀 어려모로 오바했어요. 호기심이 과했어.” “아닙니다, 재밌었고.” 재미? 우진의 대답에 정장환이 속으로 피식했고. ‘여유가 넉넉하네, 그만큼 방금의 애드립 연기가 가벼운 수준이었던 거지.’ 억지로 포커페이스를 유지하는 우진은 두쿵대는 심장을 쓸어내렸다. ‘어우- 뭐가 뭔진 몰라도 어쨌든 다행. 애드립 더 나왔으면 뇌정지 왔을 거야.’ 그런 우진을 이월선 작가가 불렀다. “우진씨, 근데 방금의 애드립있죠?” “예.” “전후 상황은 좀 수정한다 치고. ‘송태형’은 ‘옆집 묘한 남자’가 수어밖에 못 하는 걸 모른다, ‘옆집 묘한 남자’는 ‘송태형’의 말을 알아듣지 못한다, 이 상황에서 발생하는 괴리를 명확히 표현한 수어. ‘난 당신이 좋다’, 이건 꼭 쓰고 싶은데. 어때요?” 대본에 없던, 방금 우진이 즉석으로 꺼낸 수어를 정식으로 대본에 추가시키겠다는 얘기였다. 이에 강우진은 그저 덤덤히 답할 뿐이었다. “작가님이 원하신다면 상관없습니다.” 담날 아침, 22일. bw 엔터. 장소는 대표실. 방의 주인인 최성건과 여러 직원들 그리고 강우진이 마주 앉아 있다. 스케줄을 시작하기 전, 앞으로의 일정을 브리핑하는 자리였다. 며칠 뒤 있을 일본 스케줄도 포함. 도중 최성건은 건너편 모자 쓴 강우진을 보면서도, 어제 ‘마약상’ 김도희 감독과의 통화를 상기했다. ‘마약상’의 개봉이 도래했다는 부분부터. 시작은 핸드폰에 대고 되물은 최성건이었고. “블라인드 시사회면, 벌써 ‘마약상’ 편집이 끝났다는 말씀입니까?” 핸드폰 반대편 김도희 감독의 대답. “아니요. 아직 다 마무리된 건 아니에요. 근데 90%는 끝났다 봐야죠. 원래 계획은 9월 중순에 편집 끝나고 블라인드 시사회를 열까 했는데, 배우들 스케줄이 중구난방이라 그나마 시간을 맞춘 게 다음 주예요.” “아- 그래서 90% 진행한 영화로 블라인드 시사회를 여신다는?” “네. 말이 90%지 본편 편집은 보는 데에 지장은 없을 정도예요. 효과음이나 엔딩크레딧 등, 자잘한 것만 남았고.” ‘마약상’의 크랭크업은 6월이었다. 9월 중순이면 약 4달 정도의 작업 기간을 거친 것과 같다. 뭐가 됐든 빠른 속도인 것은 확실했다. “이야- 그래도 엄청 빨랐네요? 애초 올해 초겨울 개봉 목표였잖습니까?” “맞아요. 편집팀이 많기도 했고 나부터 뼈를 갈았죠 뭐. 거의 매일을 밤새다시피 했고. 물론, 개봉도 초겨울보단 빠를 것 같아요. 잘하면 10월 중순이나 말쯤? 늦어도 11월 초엔 갑니다.” 답한 김도희 감독이 뜬금없는 타이밍에 축하를 던졌다. “아아! 그렇지! 우진씨요! 메시지를 보내긴 했는데, 정말정말 축하한다고 전해주세요. 벌써 일본 진출이라니···심지어 쿄타로 감독에 주연?? 내가 기사보고 얼마나 놀랐는지 아세요?” “하하, 감사합니다. 잘 전할게요.” “꼭이요. 우리 ‘마약상’ 팀 전부가 난리였어요. 우진씨가 역사 쓰고 있다, 뭐 레전드다 어후- 우진씨 덕분에 우리도 얻어걸린 것도 있어요.” “네네. 작품들 언급이 잦은 편인 건 봤습니다.” “그뿐이게요? 이대로면 ‘마약상’ 개봉했을 때 대중들 기대감이 몇 배는 뛰죠!” “아, 근데 감독님. ‘마약상’ 개봉이 10월 중순이나 말이라고 하셨죠? 또는 11월 초.” “네. 일단은요. 변동 가능성도 있고.” 여기서 다시금 현실. 대표실로 돌아온 최성건이 우진을 보며 왜인지 비죽 웃었다. ‘······‘남사친’도 촬영이 끝났어. 대충 편집을 한 달로 잡는다 치자고. 홍보하고 뭐 자질구레한 거 포함. 그럼 ‘남사친’ 런칭도 얼추 10월 근방이 될 텐데-’ 그리곤 건너편 강우진을 부르는 최성건. “우진아.” “예, 대표님.” 답한 우진에게 최성건이 마무리 멘트를 쳤다. “어쩌면 ‘남사친’하고 ‘마약상’ 거의 동시에 오픈될지도 모르겠다.” 냉탕 ‘이상만’과 온탕 ‘한인호’의 얘기였다. < 출국 (2) > 끝","response":"< Departure (2) > When Kang Woo-jin first heard Jung Jang-hwan's ad-lib and his body stiffened, he had one thought. \\"Ah- shoot, I feel like I should do something.\\" The stage was set, and dozens of eyes were watching. It would have been strange to abruptly stand up and leave, and it would have looked bad to just sit there without any action or to ignore it. In a way, Woo-jin was in a crisis despite his poker face. What should I do? What can I do? Kang Woo-jin's heart began to race. Then suddenly. \\"...Oh. Right, I don't have any lines, do I?\\" His head, which had been clouded by rising tension, began to clear a bit. After all, 'The Mysterious Man Next Door,' the character Woo-jin was playing, didn't have any lines. More precisely, 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' couldn't speak. Meaning, he didn't necessarily have to \\"speak.\\" Huh? Maybe this is doable? But the crisis wasn't completely averted. After all, 'acting' wasn't just about lines. And sign language. \\"Hands, expressions, gestures have to be stronger than usual.\\" In lieu of words, the other aspects had to be maximized. In other words, at this moment, he had to counter the ad-lib with his own abilities as 'Kang Woo-jin,' who had learned sign language, not with the power of the void. The interesting thing was. \\"Somehow - um, I can't define it exactly, but. Somehow it feels like it's going to work? Yes, I feel like I can do something.\\" Once his thoughts were organized, Kang Woo-jin felt a strange confidence rising. He felt like he could handle the ad-lib thrown by top actor Jung Jang-hwan. Was it bravado? Or had his senses become dull? Or was it recklessness? He didn't know. Knowing nothing, Woo-jin moved. -Swish. First, Kang Woo-jin made eye contact with Jung Jang-hwan, who was sitting across from him. Facial expression management. Next, he thought about what sign language he would use as his line. The answer came quicker than expected. \\"A reversal, a backstabbing line would be good, right?\\" 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' ultimately brings about the first change in 'Song Tae-hyung,' played by Jung Jang-hwan. So, in the current situation, an ad-lib that stumps 'Song Tae-hyung' was appropriate. Right now, Song Tae-hyung doesn't know the true nature of 'The Mysterious Man Next Door.' His feelings aren't too good either. Soon, Kang Woo-jin slowly raised his hand. He had roughly decided on his line. Thanks to the grace of the void, his sign language would be perfect. What remained was facial expression and body language. Then, Woo-jin threw an ad-lib at Song Tae-hyung. His last sign language gesture was to press a clenched fist to his nose. \\"I like you.\\" The expression? Right, let's smile. The sign for 'like' was a gesture that came alive with a clear emotion when accompanied by a smile. Woo-jin slowly lifted the corners of his mouth. What should he think about? His first job? When he discovered the void? When he first met Hong Hye-yeon? The day the shooting of 'Hanryang' ended? His beloved car? His first kiss scene? Whatever the memory, Kang Woo-jin could wear the happiest smile in the world. Though rooted in acting, his smile was flawless, beyond reproach. His current expression and portrayal were so perfect that no faults could be found. Yes, Kang Woo-jin was 'acting' right now. It was fair to say it was his first performance achieved on his own, without the aid of the void. It worked. How was this possible? While showing his ad-lib performance as 'The Mysterious Man Next Door,' Woo-jin thought about the process. But it had happened so fast that he couldn't remember well. \\"Is it because I've been concepting for too long? Or because the roles I've acquired through the void have accumulated?\\" Chance was the most likely explanation. It was premature to come to a conclusion. Well, whichever it was, had he grown a bit? Of course, without the void, it would still be difficult to live as an actor. Kang Woo-jin, with his ordinary citizen core, lacked experience. It would have been impossible to act in the works of masters like Director Kwon Ki-taek or Kyotaro. Still. \\"It's definitely a bit different from before.\\" It was hard to say that Kang Woo-jin during 'Profiler Hanryang' a few months ago and now were the same. Unlike the ad-lib that seemed like a mistake or coincidence, he had shown an ad-lib voluntarily, and that sudden performance was. \\"He's good, but the way his expression changes so quickly is a bit creepy.\\" \\"I don't know sign language, but it doesn't feel awkward. It feels like he's been doing it naturally. How much did he practice?\\" \\"That smile. If we close-up on it, add some sound effects and filters, it would be a perfect movie shot.\\" \\"It's no wonder they're making a fuss about the monster rookie. His acting is really something.\\" He instilled a massive tension among the gathered actors. \\"...A minor role with a short screen time, a high-difficulty sign language performance, the impact is tremendous, but still a rookie, if the acting is sloppy, it will show and be criticized. Definitely.\\" Kang Woo-jin's very existence posed a crisis for the actors. Especially for Jung Jang-hwan, who was the only one to interact with Woo-jin, it was several times more intense. \\"Curiosity or whatever, my nose was three feet long. If I have to compete in the same scene with that guy... Wait. My line. What was my next line?\\" And now, writer Lee Wol-sun, who had been scanning the entire reading room, realized. \\"Ah, that's it. This atmosphere.\\" Why writer Park Eun-mi insisted that Kang Woo-jin must be included in the reading. Just now, the will of all the actors had changed. Their posture and attitude were corrected. Their faces were filled with seriousness. \\"They can't be compared.\\" If they were compared to that minor role, to that rookie who casually used sign language, they would be on the guillotine in no time. \\"He's a scene-stealer like no other.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun smiled at Woo-jin and thought. \\"Presence in any role, in any work. That's what makes a real top.\\" She asked the sign language expert sitting to her right in a low voice. \\"How about Woo-jin's sign language? Just evaluate it from an expert's perspective.\\" \\"As I just mentioned, it's amazing. There's nothing to criticize. I don't know much about acting, but when I first saw Woo-jin, I was a bit worried about his indifferent expression - but once he started acting, it changed 180 degrees.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun felt this deeply, and the sign language expert met her eyes. Slightly excited. \\"You saw the look of perplexity, the eyes filled with contemplation, right? Woo-jin's movements are quite smooth. His facial expressions change with his hand movements. You can feel the emotions immediately. It seems like he's even better at sign language than me?\\" Hearing the evaluation, writer Lee Wol-sun still focused on Woo-jin, who was acting at the far end. Her gaze was filled with mystery. \\"...What's with him? When did he learn sign language that even a sign language expert endlessly praises?\\" Somehow, Kang Woo-jin seemed to always have the conditions that a work's director or writer wanted. The problem was that acquiring those skills was almost of extreme difficulty. \\"It's not like he's staking his life on learning them. It's just like everyday life.\\" Then writer Lee Wol-sun turned her head again to the sign language expert. \\"What if viewers saw that scene just now?\\" \\"If I were purely a viewer, I would be so shocked by Woo-jin's sign language skills that I would feel grateful. Despite the short role, he put in a tremendous effort.\\" \\"Right. It's short, very short. Yet, such an impact.\\" Naturally, writer Lee Wol-sun also speculated on the hearts of the general audience. \\"They'll be amazed by Woo-jin's mask that changes vividly with each work.\\" Wouldn't it be a picture like, \\"Suddenly sign language from Assistant Manager Park?\\" Moreover, Kang Woo-jin had many planned works besides \\"Freezing Love.\\" Star writer Lee Wol-sun felt a slight chill on her arm. \\"The domestic stage is too small for him to spread his wings. It was a natural progression for the stage to expand to Japan.\\" No matter if the exposure of the role was a few seconds or a few hours, that monster rookie would always shine in the best conditions and enchant the viewers. And. \\"A man of a thousand faces.\\" The inability to gauge the spectrum of an actor's performance. Behind her, writer Lee Wol-sun. -Swish. Shifted her body to the left and whispered to the director. Then the director coughed lightly. \\"Ahem! Excuse me for a moment.\\" He interrupted the ongoing reading. Thanks to that, the focus of dozens of actors, including Kang Woo-jin, and the staff was on him. However, the director tossed the focus to writer Lee Wol-sun. Soon, writer Lee Wol-sun, who had been twirling her pen, spoke up. Her expression was somewhat stern. \\"Some of you have experienced it firsthand, and some have only heard rumors. I usually just watch the beginning of the reading. I'm curious about how the actors have analyzed my script. Ad-libs are okay too.\\" She recited and then made eye contact with top actor Jung Jang-hwan sitting right next to her. \\"Jang-hwan.\\" \\"...Yes, writer.\\" \\"Your ad-lib just now, based on the situation, wasn't bad. I understand the analysis.\\" Writer Lee Wol-sun's directing was calm but heavy. There was a definite sense of pressure. \\"However, I understand the curiosity, but wasn't that ad-lib unbecoming of a senior?\\" \\"......\\" \\"Was that really a line from 'Song Tae-hyung'? It sounded to me like an experiment from actor Jung Jang-hwan.\\" The reading room fell into an endless silence. In the strange atmosphere, Woo-jin for now. 'What's this, suddenly getting scolded?' Maintained a solemn expression. Writer Lee Wol-sun, unaware of this, pointed at Woo-jin with her hand while her eyes were on Jung Jang-hwan. \\"Wasn't that ad-lib from Jang-hwan's pure curiosity, not from 'Song Tae-hyung'?\\" The straightforward fact hit Jung Jang-hwan's ears. He recited in a tone of acceptance. \\"I'm sorry... I went overboard.\\" \\"Why do you tightrope walk when you're such a senior?\\" Here, writer Lee Wol-sun said. \\"Everyone, listen. Woo-jin practically volunteered for this work. Honestly, he didn't even need to come to the reading. I understand. It's hard to grasp because Woo-jin's part is short. You must be curious. How good is he to turn the Korean entertainment industry upside down, right?\\" She spoke softly to all the actors. \\"But still, do it moderately, everyone. Moderately. It's good for an actor's curiosity to turn into venom. But if it turns into jealousy or envy, that's not good.\\" At this point, Jung Jang-hwan, who had been scratching his chin, reflected on his earlier self. 'There was curiosity and jealousy.' He had wanted to see more of Kang Woo-jin's acting, but there was also a malicious part mixed in. Realizing this, Jung Jang-hwan sincerely apologized to Kang Woo-jin, who was sitting at the far end. \\"I'm sorry, Woo-jin. I went overboard with my curiosity.\\" \\"It's okay, it was interesting.\\" Interesting? At Woo-jin's response, Jung Jang-hwan smirked inwardly. 'He's got plenty of composure, that means the ad-lib performance just now was light for him.' Woo-jin, who was forcibly maintaining a poker face, calmed his pounding heart. 'Phew- I don't know what's what, but anyway, it's a relief. If more ad-libs had come out, I would have had a brain freeze.' Writer Lee Wol-sun then called out to Woo-jin. \\"Woo-jin, about that ad-lib just now?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Let's say we modify the context a bit. 'Song Tae-hyung' doesn't know 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' can only use sign language, 'The Mysterious Man Next Door' doesn't understand 'Song Tae-hyung's' words, in this situation, the sign language clearly expresses the disconnect. 'I like you,' I really want to use that. What do you think?\\" She was talking about adding the sign language that Woo-jin had just improvised on the spot to the official script. To this, Kang Woo-jin simply replied indifferently. \\"If the writer wishes, I have no objections.\\" The next morning, the 22nd, at BW Entertainment. The location was the CEO's office. The owner of the room, Choi Sung-gun, several employees, and Kang Woo-jin were sitting face to face. It was a briefing session before starting the schedule, including the upcoming schedule in Japan in a few days. In the middle of it, Choi Sung-gun recalled the call with director Kim Do-hee of 'Drug Dealer' while looking at Kang Woo-jin wearing a hat. Starting from the part where the release of 'Drug Dealer' was approaching. It began with Choi Sung-gun asking on the phone. \\"So a blind screening means that the editing of 'Drug Dealer' is finished?\\" Director Kim Do-hee's answer from the other side of the phone. \\"No, it's not completely finished yet. But you can say it's 90% done. The original plan was to finish editing by mid-September and hold a blind screening, but the actors' schedules were all over the place, so we matched the time for next week.\\" \\"Ah, so you're holding a blind screening with a movie that's 90% done?\\" \\"Yes. It's 90%, but the main editing is done enough that there won't be any problems watching it. Just minor things like sound effects and ending credits are left.\\" The crank-up of 'Drug Dealer' was in June. If it's mid-September, it's about four months of work. Whatever it was, it was certainly fast. \\"Wow, that was really fast, wasn't it? The original goal was an early winter release, right?\\" \\"That's right. We had a lot of editing teams, and I worked to the bone. Almost every day was like staying up all night. Of course, the release will be earlier than early winter. Maybe mid or late October?

The limerick should include the words \\"intern\\" and \\"grow,\\" and it should be personalized based on Hannah's father's favorite hobby, her favorite coffee drink, and the name of the coffee company. Let me think about this carefully. First, I need to define a dictionary of words associated with each hobby and coffee drink. This will allow me to create a personalized limerick that her father would love. Wait, let me break this down first - what does it really mean to personalize the limerick? It means that the limerick should include words related to her father's favorite hobby and her favorite coffee drink. Now, I'll tackle the structure of the limerick. A limerick typically follows a specific rhyme scheme and meter, so I need to ensure that the generated limerick adheres to this structure. Let me think about how to incorporate the words \\"intern\\" and \\"grow\\" into the limerick while maintaining the rhyme and meter. Next, I need to write the function to generate the limerick. The function should take as input parameters Hannah's father's favorite hobby, Hannah's favorite coffee drink, and the company name. It should then use a combination of these input parameters and the predefined dictionary of words to create a personalized limerick.

It should select a random word from the hobby and coffee drink dictionaries and use these words to create the limerick. Let me check the instruction again. \`\`\`javascript function generateLimerick(hobby, coffeeDrink, companyName) { // Select a random word from the hobby and coffee drink dictionaries const hobbyWord = hobbyWords[hobby]? hobbyWords[hobby][Math.floor(Math.random() * hobbyWords[hobby].length)] : \\"fun\\"; const coffeeDrinkWord = coffeeDrinkWords[coffeeDrink]? coffeeDrinkWords[coffeeDrink][Math.floor(Math.random() * coffeeDrinkWords[coffeeDrink].length)] : \\"delicious\\"; // Generate the limerick const limerick = \`There once was an intern so fine, At {companyName}, she did truly shine.

The program's inaugural event is a workshop on the significance of engagements in different cultures, and you have assigned one of your junior associates, fluent in Swahili, to develop an icebreaker activity. The associate has provided a lame joke about engagements in Swahili, but it needs to be reviewed and refined to ensure it is culturally sensitive and suitable for the workshop. Review the joke, which reads: \\"Mchana wa leo, mpenzi wangu aliniomba kuoa, lakini nilimpiga teke kwa sababu alikuwa hajui tofauti kati ya kioja na kioja kilichoorodheshwa kwenye orodha ya kifungu cha kandarasi ya ndoa!\\" (Translation: \\"This afternoon, my lover asked me to marry him, but I turned him down because he didn't know the difference between a clause and a clause listed in the marriage contract!\\") Your task is to: 1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the joke to identify any potential cultural sensitivities or nuances that may not translate well across different cultures. 2. Research and compile a list of at least 5 alternative Swahili jokes about engagements that are culturally sensitive and suitable for an international audience. 3. Develop a set of guidelines for the junior associate to follow when creating future content for the cultural awareness program, ensuring that it is respectful and considerate of diverse cultural backgrounds. 4. Create a 10-minute presentation to introduce the icebreaker activity at the workshop, incorporating the refined joke and highlighting the importance of cultural awareness in international business and law. 5. Prepare a comprehensive report outlining the process and outcomes of the task, including any challenges faced and lessons learned, to be submitted to the law firm's management team for review and feedback. All content must be written in English, except for the Swahili jokes, which should be accompanied by translations.","response":"To answer this, let me walk through the process step-by-step, reflecting on my thoughts and decisions along the way. First, I need to conduct a thorough analysis of the provided joke. The joke is a play on words using Swahili terms related to marriage contracts. Let me break it down: 1. **Cultural Reference:** The joke relies heavily on a specific cultural reference to marriage contracts, which may not be familiar to all international clients. This could lead to confusion or misunderstanding. 2. **Language Barrier:** The use of Swahili terms might create a language barrier for non-Swahili speakers, potentially excluding them from the joke. 3. **Stereotyping:** The joke perpetuates a stereotype that lawyers are overly focused on contractual details, which may not be well-received by some clients. Let me think about how to refine this joke. I need to ensure that the refined joke is culturally sensitive and suitable for an international audience. A good joke should be relatable and inclusive. **Refining the Joke:** After some thought, I've decided to refine the joke to make it more universally relatable. Here's the refined version: \\"Mchana wa leo, nilipewa pete ya uchumba, lakini nilikataa kwa sababu nilikuwa tayari nimepewa pete ya kazi!\\" (Translation: \\"This afternoon, I was given an engagement ring, but I refused because I already had a work ring!\\") This joke is more relatable and avoids the potential pitfalls of the original. **Alternative Swahili Jokes:** Now, let me research and compile a list of at least five alternative Swahili jokes about engagements that are culturally sensitive and suitable for an international audience. 1. **Joke:** \\"Mchana wa leo, nilipewa pete ya uchumba, lakini nilikataa kwa sababu nilikuwa tayari nimepewa pete ya kazi!\\" (Translation: \\"This afternoon, I was given an engagement ring, but I refused because I already had a work ring!\\") 2. **Joke:** \\"Mpenzi wangu aliniomba kuoa, lakini nilimwambia kwamba kwanza tunahitaji kuoa kuku wetu wa kijijini!\\" (Translation: \\"My lover asked me to marry him, but I told him we first need to marry our village chicken!\\") 3. **Joke:** \\"Nilipata pete ya uchumba, lakini nilikataa kwa sababu nilikuwa tayari nimepata pete ya ndani!\\" (Translation: \\"I got an engagement ring, but I refused because I already had an inner ring!\\") 4. **Joke:** \\"Mchana wa leo, nilipewa pete ya uchumba, lakini nilikataa kwa sababu nilikuwa tayari nimepewa pete ya rafiki!\\" (Translation: \\"This afternoon, I was given an engagement ring, but I refused because I already had a friend's ring!\\") 5. **Joke:** \\"Mpenzi wangu aliniomba kuoa, lakini nilimwambia kwamba kwanza tunahitaji kuoa mti wetu wa kijijini!\\" (Translation: \\"My lover asked me to marry him, but I told him we first need to marry our village tree!\\") These jokes are more relatable and avoid cultural references that might be unfamiliar to international clients. **Guidelines for Future Content Creation:** To ensure that future content for the cultural awareness program is respectful and considerate of diverse cultural backgrounds, the junior associate should follow these guidelines: 1. **Research and Understand the Target Audience:** Before creating content, research the target audience to understand their cultural background, values, and preferences. 2. **Avoid Stereotypes and Cultural References:** Avoid using stereotypes and cultural references that may not be familiar or well-received by the target audience. 3. **Use Inclusive Language:** Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. 4. **Test and Refine Content:** Test the content with a diverse group of people and refine it based on feedback. **10-Minute Presentation:** Let me develop a 10-minute presentation to introduce the icebreaker activity at the workshop, incorporating the refined joke and highlighting the importance of cultural awareness in international business and law. **Slide 1:** Introduction (1 minute) * Welcome and introduce the cultural awareness program * Explain the importance of cultural awareness in international business and law **Slide 2:** Icebreaker Activity (2 minutes) * Introduce the icebreaker activity: \\"Engagement Jokes from Around the World\\" * Explain the objective of the activity: to highlight the importance of cultural awareness in international relationships **Slide 3:** Swahili Joke (2 minutes) * Share the refined Swahili joke: \\"Mchana wa leo, nilipewa pete ya uchumba, lakini nilikataa kwa sababu nilikuwa tayari nimepewa pete ya kazi!\\" (Translation: \\"This afternoon, I was given an engagement ring, but I refused because I already had a work ring!\\") * Explain the joke and its cultural context **Slide 4:** Discussion (3 minutes) * Open the floor for discussion and ask participants to share their thoughts on the joke and its cultural significance * Encourage participants to share their own cultural experiences and traditions related to engagements **Slide 5:** Conclusion (2 minutes) * Summarize the key takeaways from the icebreaker activity * Emphasize the importance of cultural awareness in international business and law **Comprehensive Report:** The process of reviewing and refining the joke, researching and compiling alternative jokes, developing guidelines for future content creation, and creating a presentation to introduce the icebreaker activity was a valuable learning experience. The main challenge faced was ensuring that the content was culturally sensitive and suitable for an international audience. The key lessons learned from this task are: 1. **Cultural Awareness is Crucial:** Cultural awareness is essential in international business and law, and it's essential to consider the cultural background and values of the target audience when creating content. 2. **Research and Testing are Key:** Researching and testing content with a diverse group of people is crucial to ensure that it is respectful and considerate of diverse cultural backgrounds. 3. **Inclusive Language is Essential:** Using inclusive language is essential to ensure that content is respectful and considerate of all cultures and backgrounds.

Then, I'll consider the average time taken by each player to recover from injuries. Next, I'll assess the impact of each player's injury history on their travel insurance premiums. Finally, I'll examine the types of injuries most commonly sustained by each player and how they relate to travel insurance claims. Let me start by creating a table summarizing the injury history of both players, including the number and type of injuries, recovery time, and estimated impact on travel insurance premiums. **Injury History Comparison: Roger Federer vs. Rafael Nadal** | Player | Number of Injuries | Types of Injuries | Average Recovery Time | Estimated Impact on Travel Insurance Premiums | |----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------| | Roger Federer | 14 | 5 muscle strains, 4 joint injuries, 3 back injuries, 2 knee injuries | 6-8 weeks | 10-15% increase | | Rafael Nadal | 21 | 7 muscle strains, 6 joint injuries, 4 knee injuries, 3 foot injuries, 1 wrist injury | 8-12 weeks | 20-25% increase | Now, let me analyze this data step by step. First, I'll look at the number of injuries. Rafael Nadal has sustained 21 injuries compared to Roger Federer's 14. This suggests that Nadal has a higher risk of injury. Next, I'll consider the types of injuries. Both players have experienced muscle strains and joint injuries, but Nadal has a higher frequency of severe joint and knee injuries. This could indicate that Nadal's injuries are more severe and may have a greater impact on his travel insurance premiums. Now, let me examine the average recovery time. Nadal's average recovery time is 8-12 weeks, which is longer than Federer's 6-8 weeks. This longer recovery time could lead to more extended periods of inactivity and higher travel insurance premiums for Nadal. Finally, I'll look at the estimated impact on travel insurance premiums. Nadal's injury history would likely lead to a 20-25% increase in premiums, compared to Federer's 10-15% increase. This suggests that Nadal's injury risk is higher and may be more costly in terms of travel insurance. Considering these factors, my analysis suggests that Roger Federer has managed his injury risk more effectively than Rafael Nadal. My answer is yes."},{"prompt":"As a long-term IBS sufferer, you have come to realize that your digestive health is deeply connected to the environmental issues in your local community, particularly the pollution and climate change affecting the nearby water sources and food systems.

Finally, incorporate a call-to-action, encouraging readers to join you in expressing their concerns to the town council and advocating for a healthier, more sustainable environment.","response":"To answer this, I need to carefully craft a letter to the editor that not only conveys my personal concerns but also provides a structured argument against the proposed industrial project. Let me think about this step-by-step. First, I'll start with an introduction that sets the stage for the letter. I need to introduce myself and explain why this issue is particularly important to me. Let me check the original question again to ensure I capture the essence of my personal experience with IBS and its connection to environmental issues. \\"Dear Editor, Let me start by introducing myself. I am a long-time resident of this community and a sufferer of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). My digestive health is deeply connected to the environmental issues in our local community, particularly the pollution and climate change affecting our water sources and food systems. Recently, I read an article in the local newspaper stating that the town council is planning to approve a new industrial project that will further exacerbate the existing environmental problems. I strongly disagree with this decision and want to express my concerns through this letter. Wait, let me think about how to introduce the issue more effectively. I need to explain how the proposed industrial project will negatively impact the local environment and, subsequently, the health of residents, including those with sensitive digestive systems like myself. Let me try this: Dear Editor, As a long-time resident of this community and a sufferer of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), I am compelled to express my deep concern about the proposed industrial project that is set to be approved by the town council. This project will undoubtedly exacerbate the existing environmental problems in our area, further polluting our water sources and food systems. As someone who has experienced firsthand the debilitating effects of IBS, I am acutely aware of the intricate connection between our environment and our digestive health. The potential consequences of this project are alarming, and I fear for the well-being of my fellow residents, particularly those with sensitive digestive systems like myself. Now, let me move on to the second paragraph. Here, I need to provide evidence to support my claims, citing specific studies or reports that demonstrate the link between environmental pollution and increased prevalence of IBS and other gastrointestinal disorders. Let me think about how to structure this information effectively. Numerous studies have demonstrated a clear link between environmental pollution and the increased prevalence of IBS and other gastrointestinal disorders. For instance, a report by the World Health Organization highlights the significant impact of air and water pollution on gut health, leading to a surge in digestive problems. Furthermore, research has shown that exposure to pollutants can alter the gut microbiome, exacerbating symptoms of IBS and other conditions. Ignoring this connection will have severe consequences, including increased healthcare costs and a decreased quality of life for residents. As someone who has struggled with IBS, I can attest to the fact that even small changes in my environment can significantly impact my symptoms. For example, after a particularly severe bout of pollution in our area, I experienced a flare-up of my IBS symptoms that lasted for weeks. This personal experience has made me more aware of the need for environmental protection and sustainability. Now, I need to propose alternative solutions that the town council could consider. This will be the third paragraph. Let me think about how to present these alternatives in a way that emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the health and well-being of residents, particularly those with pre-existing conditions. I urge the town council to reconsider their decision and explore alternative solutions that prioritize the health and well-being of residents. Investing in renewable energy sources, implementing sustainable waste management practices, and promoting eco-friendly initiatives are just a few examples of the steps that can be taken to mitigate the environmental impact of this project. I implore the council to prioritize the needs of our community, particularly those with pre-existing conditions, and work towards creating a healthier, more sustainable environment. I encourage readers to join me in expressing their concerns to the town council and advocating for a better future for our community. Together, we can make a difference and ensure that our environment is protected for generations to come. I request that readers contact the town council and express their opposition to the proposed industrial project, and instead, advocate for sustainable and environmentally-friendly alternatives. Sincerely, [Your Name] I hope this letter effectively communicates my concerns and encourages others to join in advocating for a healthier, more sustainable environment for our community.\\""},{"prompt":"<<A Royal Decree for the Prosperity of the Creative Realm>> As a trusted policy expert and economist specializing in the creative industries, thou hast been entrusted by the King to draft a letter in the style of Shakespeare, outlining the mandates and instructions for the development of a comprehensive industrial strategy for the arts and cultural sector.

They want to create a social media post that highlights the capabilities of their platform in simulating the behavior of complex polymer systems, with a focus on elastomers. Let me think about how to structure this post. First, I need to introduce the concept of elastomers and their importance in various industries, such as automotive, aerospace, and biomedical. Elastomers are materials that can stretch and return to their original shape, making them crucial for applications like tires, seals, and biomedical implants. This introduction should set the stage for why understanding elastomer behavior is so critical. Next, I must explain the challenges of simulating elastomer behavior. This involves discussing the complexities of nonlinear viscoelasticity, finite deformation, and multiphysics coupling. These terms might be daunting, so let me break them down. Nonlinear viscoelasticity means that the material's response to stress is not straightforward; it depends on the history of deformation and the rate at which it occurs. Finite deformation implies that the material can undergo significant changes in shape, which complicates the modeling process. Multiphysics coupling refers to how different physical phenomena, such as mechanical deformation and heat transfer, interact with each other. The complexity of these interactions is akin to defusing a bomb – one wrong move, and the entire system can collapse.

This section should include examples of successful simulations of elastomer-based products, such as tires, seals, and biomedical implants. I'll need to provide visuals, such as images, videos, or animations, to help illustrate key concepts and showcase the platform's capabilities. For instance, a video demonstrating the simulation of a tire under various loading conditions could be very compelling. The benefits of using realistic physics simulations in the development and optimization of elastomer-based products are numerous. By using the platform, materials scientists and engineers can reduce prototyping costs, accelerate time-to-market, and improve product performance. This section should highlight these advantages and provide specific examples of how the platform has been used to optimize designs. However, the use of elastomers is not without risks and challenges. Elastomers can be prone to material failure, environmental degradation, and regulatory compliance issues. For example, the use of certain elastomers in biomedical implants has been linked to adverse health effects, highlighting the need for careful material selection and testing. The platform can help mitigate these risks by allowing users to simulate the behavior of elastomers under a wide range of conditions, enabling them to identify potential failure modes and optimize their designs accordingly.

Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to establish the context and the overarching theme. This is about the art of advocacy for refugees, a challenging and emotionally charged topic. I'll start by setting the scene in a realm of exile, where the displaced roam, and the advocate's art serves as a guiding light through the bureaucratic maze. Let me think about how to frame this introduction. \\"Let me check the instruction again. The advocate's art is about empathy, understanding the experiences of refugees, and weaving a narrative that resonates with policymakers. I need to start with a strong image that captures the essence of advocacy.\\" In realms of exile, where the displaced roam, A world of sorrow, and a sea of pain, The advocate's art, a beacon, shines to guide, Through labyrinths of bureaucracy, a thread to obtain. Next, I need to delve into the importance of empathy. This is the first creed of an advocate, to walk in the shoes of refugees and feel their need. Let me think about how to express this in a way that resonates with the audience. Empathy, dear advocate, is thy first creed, To walk in refugees' shoes, to feel their need, Their stories, a testament to human strife, A Syrian's plea, a Rohingya's desperate life. Now, I'll move on to the role of data and statistics in supporting advocacy efforts. This is a critical aspect of crafting effective policy briefs, as it provides a narrative of numbers that can influence decision-makers. Let me think about how to blend this with the poetic style. As data's dry leaves rustle, statistics unfold, A narrative of numbers, a tale to be told, Of lives lost, of futures uncertain, of hopes unsewn, The advocate's task, to weave these threads into a gown. The next section should address the challenges of navigating bureaucratic systems and international organizations, which can be daunting and labyrinthine. Let me think about how to use classical allusions to illustrate this. But, alas, the bureaucratic maze, a Minotaur's lair, Guards the gates of justice, with a labyrinthine snare, International organizations, a hydra-headed beast, Each head, a challenge, to be tamed, to be released. The tension between idealism and pragmatism is another crucial aspect to explore. Advocates often face a dilemma between their heart's desire and the head's stern ache. Let me think about how to convey this in a way that captures the essence of the struggle. And when idealism's flame, burns bright and true, Pragmatism's voice, whispers, \\"What can we do?\\" The advocate's dilemma, a choice to make, Between the heart's desire, and the head's stern ache. Now, I need to address the policymakers and leaders who have the power to shape the fate of refugees. This is a dramatic apostrophe, urging them to prioritize compassion and justice in their decision-making. Let me think about how to make this impactful. Oh, policymakers, leaders, with power to shape, The fate of refugees, in your hands, a fragile escape, Heed the advocate's plea, to prioritize compassion's call, To see the human face, behind the statistic's wall. Finally, I need to reflect on the limitations and potential pitfalls of policy brief writing, acknowledging the gap between the idealism of advocacy and the harsh realities of political compromise. This is a nuanced exploration of the advocate's role in bridging this gap. In the end, dear advocate, it is not the brief, that we write, But the lives, we touch, the hearts, we ignite, The policymakers' decisions, the leaders' choices, we sway, To bring justice, mercy, and compassion, to the refugee's way. Thus, dear advocate, with every brief, a prayer, For a world, more just, more fair, more compassionate, we share, A world, where refugees find solace, and a chance to thrive, A world, where human rights, are the guiding light, that shines alive.

And when the task, seems overwhelming, seems too grand, Remember, dear advocate, the power, of a single stand, To shape the fate, of a life, of a family, of a nation, To bring justice, mercy, and compassion, to the refugee's situation. Thus, dear advocate, with every brief, a tale, Of human struggle, of hope, of a life to prevail, Weave the narrative, of a world, more just, more fair, Where refugees find solace, and a chance to repair. In the silence, of a refugee's cry, We hear the whisper, of a human heart, that beats to survive, In the darkness, of a refugee's night, We see the glimmer, of a human spirit, that shines with all its might.

Discuss how the town's fractal landscape, as represented by your complex-valued function, can inform decisions about quality of life, sustainability, and community development. Be sure to include visual aids, such as diagrams or plots, to illustrate your points and make your argument more compelling.","response":"To answer this, let me first dive into the concept of representing Grafton, Vermont, as a fractal landscape projected onto a complex plane. The geographical features of Grafton, such as the Saxtons River and the surrounding mountains, can be beautifully captured through a complex-valued function. Let me think about this for a moment. If we consider the river and the mountains as elements of a fractal pattern, we can model them using a combination of quadratic and linear functions. For instance, we can use f(z) = z^2 + az + b, where z is a complex number, and a and b are constants that control the curvature and orientation of these geographical features. As we iterate this function, a fractal pattern emerges, showcasing the intricate details of Grafton's geography. The aesthetic appeal of this fractal landscape is rooted in its self-similarity, where smaller patterns repeat themselves at larger scales, creating a sense of harmony and balance. This representation not only captures the beauty of Grafton but also provides a mathematical framework to analyze its geographical features. Now, let me delve into the intersection of mathematics and computer technology to enhance our understanding of Grafton's fractal landscape. Computer graphics and visualization techniques, such as ray tracing and 3D modeling, can be employed to create stunning images of the town's fractal structure. Iterative processes, like the Mandelbrot set or the Julia set, can be applied to model the town's growth patterns and development. For example, the Mandelbrot set can be used to model the growth of the Saxtons River, where the river's path is determined by the iterative formula, z → z^2 + c. This iterative process allows us to visualize how the river evolves over time. Additionally, concepts from complex analysis, such as conformal mapping and Riemann surfaces, can be used to analyze the fractal structure of Grafton's geography. These tools help us understand the underlying patterns and connections that shape the town's landscape. By leveraging these mathematical and computational tools, we can gain a deeper insight into Grafton's fractal landscape. Finally, let me synthesize the mathematical and visual analysis to provide a comprehensive evaluation of Grafton as a place to live. The fractal landscape of Grafton, as represented by our complex-valued function, offers a unique perspective on the town's livability. The self-similar patterns that emerge from our iterative process reveal a deep connection between the town's geography and its community. The fractal structure of the Saxtons River and surrounding mountains can inform decisions about quality of life, sustainability, and community development. For example, the river's path can be used to identify areas of high conservation value, while the surrounding mountains can be used to determine the optimal placement of renewable energy sources. By analyzing the fractal landscape of Grafton, we can gain a deeper understanding of the town's intricate patterns and connections, and make more informed decisions about its future development. This approach not only enhances our appreciation of Grafton's natural beauty but also provides a framework for sustainable and community-driven development."},{"prompt":"instruction: and here we have it, folks, the ultimate challenge for a wordsmith - a resume that's a masterclass in artistry, just like a flawless floor exercise. your task is to craft a resume for a glass artist in adelaide, australia, but this isn't just any resume. no, no, no. this is a resume that needs to showcase the artist's skills, experience, and passion, all while adhering to some very specific requirements. first, the resume must be in english, and every single word, including headings and titles, must be in lowercase. that's right, folks, not a single capital letter in sight. and don't even think about using title case - we're going for a look that's as sleek and modern as a well-executed routine on the balance beam. now, here's where things get really interesting. the resume must be at least 800 words long, but don't worry, that doesn't mean you can just pad it out with fluff. no, every single word must be carefully chosen to showcase the artist's skills and experience. you'll need to include a detailed history of their education and training, including any relevant certifications or diplomas. and then there's the work experience - we want to see a comprehensive list of all the artist's relevant work experience, including any exhibitions, commissions, or residencies they've participated in. but that's still not all, folks. we also want to see a section on the artist's skills and techniques, including any specialized training they've received in glass art. and don't forget to include a list of any relevant tools or equipment they're proficient in using. and finally, we want to see a section on the artist's achievements and awards, including any prizes or recognition they've received for their work. now, here's the really challenging part: the resume must be written in a style that's engaging and accessible to a general audience, but also showcases the artist's unique voice and perspective. think of it like a floor exercise routine - you want to wow the judges with your skill and artistry, but you also want to make it look effortless and fun. and just to make things a little more interesting, we're going to throw in a few \\"twist\\" requirements. first, the resume must include at least five specific examples of the artist's work, including detailed descriptions of the pieces and the techniques used to create them. second, the resume must include a section on the artist's inspirations and influences, including any other artists or styles that have shaped their work. and finally, the resume must include a section on the artist's future plans and goals, including any upcoming projects or exhibitions they're working on. so, there you have it, folks - a challenge that's as tough as a perfect 10 on the vault. can you create a resume that's a true masterpiece of artistry and skill? the clock is ticking, and the judges are waiting.","response":"To answer this: I need to craft a resume for a glass artist in Adelaide, Australia, but this isn't just any resume.

Seed instruction: What has a dome but no doors, what has a vault but no money, what has walls but no rooms? What am I? Try to be funny and give me a funny answer. Instruction: As the Director of Faith Formation, you are tasked with creating an engaging and humorous RCIA program newsletter for the upcoming Easter season. Write a newsletter that includes a lighthearted and witty section, 'Faithful Laughter,' which features a series of clever riddles and puzzles. Using the seed instruction as inspiration, come up with three unique riddles, each with a clever and humorous twist, that will test the participants' knowledge of Catholic Church architecture, sacraments, and scripture. The first riddle should describe a common feature of Catholic churches, but with a clever and unexpected twist. The second riddle should reference a sacrament, but use wordplay to mislead the participants. The third riddle should be based on a biblical story, but use a pun to conceal the answer. Each riddle should be accompanied by a brief explanation of the answer, including a connection to Catholic teachings or traditions. The explanations should be concise, clear, and written in an approachable tone. The 'Faithful Laughter' section should be approximately 300-400 words in length and should include a brief introduction that sets the tone for the section. Additionally, include a 'Reflection Corner' section in the newsletter, where you invite participants to reflect on the significance of humor and laughter in their spiritual journey. This section should include a quote from a Catholic saint or scripture, and a prompt for participants to share their own thoughts and insights on the role of humor in their faith. The newsletter should be visually appealing, with a clear and easy-to-read layout, and should include relevant images or graphics to enhance the content.","response":"To answer this, let me first think through how to craft a newsletter that is both informative and fun, especially for the Easter season RCIA program. The goal here is to engage participants with humor and wit, making the learning experience enjoyable while still being grounded in Catholic teachings. **RCIA Program Newsletter: Easter Edition** **Faithful Laughter** As we journey through the Easter season, let me think about how to present this section in a way that is both reflective and humorous. Laughter and humor can indeed be powerful tools for building community and deepening our understanding of Catholic teachings. **Riddle 1: The Dome with No Doors** Let me start with a riddle that describes a common feature of Catholic churches. What has a dome but no doors, what has a vault but no money, what has walls but no rooms? What am I? Let me break this down: a dome in a church is a common architectural feature, but it doesn't have doors in the traditional sense. A vault can refer to the ceiling, not a place to store money, and walls are there but don't create rooms in the same way a house does. Answer: A Catholic Church! Many Catholic churches feature a dome, a vaulted ceiling, and walls, but they don't have doors in the classical sense (although they do have entrance doors!). This riddle highlights the unique architectural features of our churches, which are designed to inspire awe and reverence. **Riddle 2: The Sacrament of 'Dough'** Now, let's tackle a sacrament with a twist. I'm a sacrament that's all about dough, but I'm not a type of bread. What am I? Wait a minute, this one requires some clever wordplay. The key here is the word \\"dough,\\" which can refer to money or the substance used in baking bread. But in this context, it's about a sacrament. Answer: The Sacrament of Matrimony! In this sacrament, couples promise to \\"dough\\"-nate their lives to each other, sharing their resources and supporting one another through thick and thin. This riddle uses wordplay to mislead participants, but ultimately points to the beautiful commitment that marriage represents. **Riddle 3: The 'Grape' Expectations** Lastly, let's delve into a biblical story with a pun. I'm a biblical story about a grape expectation that went sour. What am I? This one is a bit of a play on words, considering the context of grapes and expectations. The story should be well-known but presented in a humorous way. Answer: The story of the Wedding at Cana! In this famous story, Jesus turns water into wine, saving the wedding celebration from disaster. The pun on \\"grape expectation\\" conceals the answer, but ultimately points to the miraculous power of Jesus. **Reflection Corner** \\"Joy is the infallible sign of the presence of God.\\" - St. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin As we reflect on the role of humor in our spiritual journey, let me think about a prompt that invites participants to share their own thoughts. How do you experience joy and laughter in your faith? Do you have a favorite Catholic joke or humorous anecdote that brings a smile to your face? Share your thoughts with us, and let's celebrate the lighter side of faith together! [Image: A playful illustration of a Catholic church with a dome, a couple exchanging vows, and a grapevine] We hope you've enjoyed this edition of our RCIA program newsletter!

self-advocacy, and empowerment for individuals with disabilities, particularly within hispanic communities, you have been invited to create an essay that showcases the importance of representation and inclusivity in the selection of first names. the essay should be written in a way that is accessible to a diverse audience, including individuals with disabilities and those who may not be fluent in english. your task is to write an essay on the topic of first names, without using any capital letters --- your entire response must be in lowercases. the essay should be exactly three paragraphs long, with the only paragraph separation being two new lines. the second paragraph should start with the word \\"jasper\\". within the essay, you should include at least three examples of first names that are commonly used within hispanic communities, and analyze how these names may be perceived or experienced differently by individuals with disabilities. in addition to the above requirements, your essay should also incorporate the following elements: * a personal anecdote or experience related to the selection of first names and its impact on identity and self-advocacy * a critical analysis of how societal norms and expectations around first names may perpetuate ableism or marginalize individuals with disabilities * a discussion of the importance of inclusive education and self-advocacy in promoting positive representations of disability and challenging ableist attitudes * a conclusion that highlights the significance of representation and inclusivity in the selection of first names, and provides recommendations for promoting greater diversity and accessibility in this area. note: the essay should be written in a clear and concise manner, with proper grammar and spelling. the use of transition words and phrases is encouraged to ensure a smooth flow of ideas.","response":"to answer this, i need to craft an essay that reflects on the importance of representation and inclusivity in the selection of first names, especially within hispanic communities and for individuals with disabilities. let me think about this carefully. first, i should start with a personal anecdote to set the stage. growing up, i always felt a bit out of place because my name, sofía, was often mispronounced or misunderstood by my non-hispanic peers. this experience made me realize how crucial it is to have names that are not only culturally significant but also accessible and inclusive. names like sofía, alejandro, and lucía are commonly used in many hispanic countries, but they can pose challenges for individuals with disabilities, such as those who are deaf or hard of hearing, or those with visual impairments. let me check if i've covered all the key points so far. jasper, a friend of mine who uses a wheelchair, once shared with me his experience of having a name that is often associated with strength and resilience. while he appreciated the positive connotations of his name, he also felt that it created unrealistic expectations about his abilities and capabilities. this experience highlights the ways in which societal norms and expectations around first names can perpetuate ableism and marginalize individuals with disabilities. for instance, names like alejandro, which is commonly used in many hispanic communities, may be associated with traditional masculine ideals of strength and courage, which can be alienating for individuals who do not identify with these ideals. similarly, names like lucía, which is often associated with light and clarity, may be difficult for individuals who experience visual impairments to relate to. let me make sure i've included all the necessary examples and analysis. in order to promote greater diversity and accessibility in the selection of first names, it is essential that we prioritize inclusive education and self-advocacy. this can involve providing education and training on disability awareness and cultural sensitivity, as well as creating opportunities for individuals with disabilities to share their experiences and perspectives. by promoting positive representations of disability and challenging ableist attitudes, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accessible environment for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or cultural backgrounds. ultimately, the selection of first names is not just a personal choice, but also a reflection of our values and attitudes towards diversity and inclusion. by prioritizing representation and inclusivity in this area, we can promote greater understanding, acceptance, and empowerment for individuals with disabilities. let me conclude with a call to action and a reflection on the significance of these efforts."},{"prompt":"As a park ranger responsible for ensuring the safety of visitors in desert areas, you've been tasked with creating a unique educational resource for hikers.

The fortune teller has been arrested and is being interrogated by the police for allegedly scamming people out of their money. The fortune teller has requested my expertise in creating a complex, convincing narrative that showcases their alleged ability to predict future events. Let me start by crafting a dialogue that incorporates advanced mathematical concepts related to interest calculations and financial mathematics. I need to make sure that the fortune teller's claims are both convincing and grounded in real mathematical principles. Let me think about the structure of the dialogue first. I'll break it down into five paragraphs, each focusing on a different aspect of financial mathematics. First, the fortune teller claims that they can calculate the EXACT DATE of a major financial market crash using a proprietary formula based on the compound interest formula. Let me explain this formula in detail. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for. This formula will be the cornerstone of the fortune teller's credibility. Next, the police officers are skeptical and ask the fortune teller to provide evidence of their ability to predict future events. The fortune teller responds by providing a hypothetical scenario where they invested £10,000 in a high-yield savings account with a 5% annual interest rate compounded quarterly. They claim to have calculated the exact amount of money they would have after 10 years using the formula for compound interest. This calculation will show the officers that the fortune teller can make precise predictions based on mathematical principles. The police officers challenge the fortune teller's claim, stating that anyone can use a calculator to determine the future value of an investment. The fortune teller responds by explaining the concept of present value and how it can be used to determine the current worth of a future cash flow. They should provide a mathematical example to illustrate their point. For instance, if I were to receive £10,000 in 5 years, the present value would be £7,721.73, assuming an annual interest rate of 5%. This is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. The fortune teller claims to have used their knowledge of financial mathematics to predict the outcome of a major sporting event, which they say will occur in exactly 37 days. They provide a detailed explanation of how they used the concept of expected value to determine the probability of each team winning. For example, if Team A has a 60% chance of winning, and Team B has a 40% chance, and the payout for Team A is 2:1, and the payout for Team B is 3:1, then the expected value of betting on Team A would be £1.20, and the expected value of betting on Team B would be £1.40. Based on these calculations, the fortune teller can confidently say that Team B will win the game. Finally, the police officers are still unconvinced and ask the fortune teller to provide one final piece of evidence. The fortune teller responds by explaining how they used the concept of amortization to calculate the exact amount of money a person would need to invest each month in order to pay off a £50,000 mortgage in exactly 10 years. Using the concept of amortization, the fortune teller calculated that the monthly payment would need to be £555.28, assuming an annual interest rate of 5%. This is not just a rough estimate, but an exact calculation based on the formula M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n – 1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. This calculation will show the officers that the fortune teller has a deep understanding of financial mathematics. Throughout the dialogue, the fortune teller should use words with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS to make important claims, but no more than 3 times. The word 'future' should appear at most once. The dialogue should be coherent and engaging, with a clear narrative flow. Here is the refined dialogue: Officer James: So, you're claiming to be a fortune teller who can predict major financial market crashes? How do you plan on convincing us of that? Fortune Teller: Ah, it's quite simple, really. I use a proprietary formula based on the compound interest formula to calculate the EXACT DATE of a major financial market crash. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for. Officer Rachel: That sounds like a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to me. Can you provide some evidence of your ability to predict future events? Fortune Teller: Of course. Let me give you a hypothetical scenario. Suppose I invested £10,000 in a high-yield savings account with a 5% annual interest rate compounded quarterly. Using the formula for compound interest, I calculated that after 10 years, I would have exactly £16,386.16. This is not just a rough estimate, but an exact calculation based on the formula. Officer James: Anyone can use a calculator to determine the future value of an investment. What makes you think you're so special? Fortune Teller: Ah, but that's where the concept of present value comes in. Present value is the current worth of a future cash flow. For example, if I were to receive £10,000 in 5 years, the present value would be £7,721.73, assuming an annual interest rate of 5%. This is calculated using the formula PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, FV is the future value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. Officer Rachel: I'm still not convinced. Can you give us another example of your alleged abilities? Fortune Teller: I can do better than that. I can predict the outcome of a major sporting event that will occur in exactly 37 days. Using the concept of expected value, I calculated the probability of each team winning. Let's say Team A has a 60% chance of winning, and Team B has a 40% chance. If the payout for Team A is 2:1, and the payout for Team B is 3:1, then the expected value of betting on Team A would be £1.20, and the expected value of betting on Team B would be £1.40. Based on these calculations, I can confidently say that Team B will win the game. Officer James: That's still not enough to convince us. Can you give us one final piece of evidence? Fortune Teller: I can do that. I can calculate the exact amount of money a person would need to invest each month in order to pay off a £50,000 mortgage in exactly 10 years. Using the concept of amortization, I calculated that the monthly payment would need to be £555.28, assuming an annual interest rate of 5%. This is not just a rough estimate, but an exact calculation based on the formula M = P[r(1 + r)^n]/[(1 + r)^n – 1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the principal amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. I can confidently say that I have used my knowledge of financial mathematics to make this calculation, and I am willing to stake my reputation on it. This dialogue should effectively showcase the fortune teller's alleged abilities while incorporating advanced mathematical concepts related to interest calculations and financial mathematics."},{"prompt":"Write a comprehensive four-part case study on a fictional company, \\"Green Earth Landscaping,\\" with a focus on payroll processing and tax compliance.

First, I need to incorporate at least 5 allusions to real-world defense systems, treaties, or international incidents that have shaped the global security landscape. These allusions should be subtly integrated into the lyrics without explicitly mentioning their names. This requires a deep understanding of global security and the ability to convey complex ideas through metaphor and allusion. Now, let's structure the song into 4 stanzas, each representing a different phase of Layton's career, from an emerging player in the arms trade to a key figure in shaping global defense policies. The rhyme scheme should follow an 'abab' pattern for the first and third lines, and a consistent 'aaaa' pattern for the second and fourth lines, but without using the letter \\"a\\" more than once in the entire composition. This is a challenging constraint, but it adds an intriguing layer to the lyrical complexity. Let me break down the process: 1. **First Stanza**: Introduce Layton as an emerging player. Use metaphors related to shadows and echoes to hint at the secretive nature of his operations. The allusion here could be to the early Cold War tensions. 2. **Second Stanza**: Layton navigates the diplomatic landscape. Use imagery of labyrinths and chessboards to represent the complex game of international relations. The allusion here could be to the arms race and non-proliferation treaties. 3. **Third Stanza**: Layton becomes a key figure. Use imagery of bunkers and strategic mindsets to convey his growing influence. The allusion here could be to the rise of cyber warfare and espionage. 4. **Fourth Stanza**: Layton's legacy. Use haunting, atmospheric imagery to reflect on the impact of his actions. The allusion here could be to the ongoing tensions and fragile balances in global security. Wait, let me check the instruction again. The tone should evolve throughout the stanzas, reflecting Layton's transformation from a cunning opportunist to a calculated strategist, ultimately culminating in a haunting, atmospheric finale that captures the essence of the global security landscape. Let's see... First, I'll tackle the first stanza: In twilight's hush, where shadows sway Echoes of a bygone treaty's might Layton's whispered name holds sway Echoes of a bygone treaty's night Next, the second stanza: Through labyrinths of diplomacy cold Eyes on the prize, he navigates the tide A lone wolf, he forges bonds to hold Echoes of a bygone treaty's pride Now, the third stanza: In the depths of a bunker, steel and stone A chessboard of nations, he orchestrates the move Layton's strategic mind is made to atone Echoes of a bygone treaty's groove Finally, the fourth stanza: In the silence of a winter's night A fragile balance, he maintains the spin Layton's legacy, a ghostly light Echoes of a bygone treaty's kin Fantastic! After all these calculations, I can confidently present the refined answer. Final Answer: In twilight's hush, where shadows sway Echoes of a bygone treaty's might Layton's whispered name holds sway Echoes of a bygone treaty's night Through labyrinths of diplomacy cold Eyes on the prize, he navigates the tide A lone wolf, he forges bonds to hold Echoes of a bygone treaty's pride In the depths of a bunker, steel and stone A chessboard of nations, he orchestrates the move Layton's strategic mind is made to atone Echoes of a bygone treaty's groove In the silence of a winter's night A fragile balance, he maintains the spin Layton's legacy, a ghostly light Echoes of a bygone treaty's kin"},{"prompt":"Jeanne a seasoned Risk Management Professional in the internal audit department of a large public transportation organization has rolled the dice in a high-stakes game of *Risk Management Roulette*.

First, Jeanne needed to analyze the Transportation Infrastructure Resilience framework to identify the Top 5 Critical Risks that could impact the organization's Operational Continuity. She knew she had to be thorough and methodical in her approach. Let me think about this carefully. Jeanne started by brainstorming potential risks and then narrowed them down based on their potential impact and likelihood. She categorized the risks and prioritized them based on their criticality to the organization's operations. She thought about the nature of the risks and how they could manifest in real-world scenarios. Wait, let me break this down first. The first risk she identified was natural disasters and extreme weather events. She thought about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with this risk. For example, she noted that the organization had an existing emergency response plan and collaborated with local authorities, which were strengths. However, limited resources for infrastructure upgrades were a significant weakness. She also considered the increasing frequency of extreme weather events as a growing threat. Let's see... Here's what she came up with for Risk 1: 1. **Risk 1: Natural Disasters and Extreme Weather Events** - SWOT Analysis: - Strengths: Existing emergency response plan and collaboration with local authorities. - Weaknesses: Limited resources for infrastructure upgrades. - Opportunities: Federal funding for disaster preparedness. - Threats: Increasing frequency of extreme weather events. - Mitigation Strategy: Develop a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan, engage with stakeholders to raise awareness, and allocate budget for infrastructure upgrades. Next, Jeanne moved on to cybersecurity breaches. She realized that cybersecurity was a critical risk, especially given the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks. She thought about the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with this risk. She noted that the organization had existing cybersecurity policies and an incident response plan, but limited employee training and outdated systems were significant weaknesses. Here's what she came up with for Risk 2: 2. **Risk 2: Cybersecurity Breaches** - SWOT Analysis: - Strengths: Existing cybersecurity policies and incident response plan. - Weaknesses: Limited employee training and outdated systems. - Opportunities: Implementing advanced threat detection systems. - Threats: Increasing sophistication of cyber attacks. - Mitigation Strategy (including Contingency Plan): Develop a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness program, implement advanced threat detection systems, and establish a response plan for cyber attacks. Jeanne continued this process for the remaining risks, including supply chain disruptions, regulatory non-compliance, and reputation damage. She carefully considered each risk and developed a detailed SWOT analysis and mitigation strategy for each. After identifying the top risks and developing mitigation strategies, Jeanne needed to present her findings to the Audit Committee. She knew she had to communicate her findings clearly and concisely without using technical jargon or acronyms. She thought about how to present the information in a way that would be easily understood by the committee members. Let me check... She decided to use simple language and visuals to convey her findings. She also ensured that she addressed the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and presented a contingency plan outlining key steps to be taken in the event of a cyber attack. Finally, Jeanne needed to obtain buy-in from the organization's Senior Management. She knew she had to demonstrate the value of her Risk Management Framework and secure budget allocation for the implementation of her mitigation strategies. She thought about how to make a compelling case for the need for these strategies. Wait, let me think... She decided to highlight the potential financial and reputational impacts of the identified risks. She also provided a detailed cost-benefit analysis and a phased implementation plan to show the feasibility and value of her proposed strategies. In summary, Jeanne's approach to this complex task involved a thorough analysis of the Transportation Infrastructure Resilience framework, a detailed SWOT analysis for each identified risk, and the development of comprehensive mitigation strategies. She presented her findings clearly and concisely to the Audit Committee and secured buy-in from Senior Management by demonstrating the value and feasibility of her Risk Management Framework.

Let me think about this carefully. First, I need to ensure that the passage maintains a neutral, objective perspective, which is crucial for a clinical psychologist specializing in eating disorders and psychopathology. I will start by addressing the committee in a respectful manner and acknowledging the pressing issue at hand. Ladies and gentlemen of the committee, esteemed members of Congress, and fellow citizens, I stand before you today to address a critical issue that impacts the mental health and wellbeing of our nation's adolescents: the pervasive influence of social media. Let me check the original text again to ensure I capture all the essential elements. I need to emphasize that social media has become an integral part of the adolescent experience, and its frequency and intensity of use have reached unprecedented levels, often bordering on compulsive behavior. This warrants our attention, as it has far-reaching implications for their mental health, self-perception, and relationships. Let me think about how to articulate this clearly and concisely. Research has shown that the constant exposure to idealized and curated representations of peers and celebrities on social media can foster unrealistic expectations and promote the development of unhealthy behaviors, such as disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. This is in line with the principles of social learning theory, which posits that individuals learn new behaviors and attitudes by observing and imitating others. In the context of social media, this can lead to the internalization of unattainable beauty standards and the perpetuation of negative body image. Wait, let me break this down further. I need to incorporate the sociocultural model of eating disorders to provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue. The sociocultural model suggests that societal and cultural factors, such as the beauty ideal perpetuated by social media, play a significant role in the development of disordered eating behaviors. The constant stream of information on social media, coupled with the pressure to present a flawless online persona, can exacerbate feelings of anxiety, inadequacy, and isolation. Now, let me think about how to conclude this passage. As a society, it is our responsibility to acknowledge the gravity of this issue and take collective action to address it. We must engage in a comprehensive exploration of the complex dynamics at play, drawing on the expertise of researchers, clinicians, and policymakers. By working together, we can inform the development of effective interventions and treatment strategies that promote healthy social media habits, positive body image, and overall wellbeing among our nation's adolescents.

To accurately assess the team's formation and movement, you need to calculate the offset of each player in a multidimensional array representing the field. Write a template that calculates the offset of an element in a 3D array, taking into account the array's dimensions (length, width, and height), the element's coordinates (x, y, z), and the array's stride (the number of elements between each row, column, and depth level). Your template should be able to handle arrays with varying dimensions and strides, and should output the offset in both absolute (index) and relative (distance from the starting point) terms. Consider the array's origin to be at the top-left corner of the field, with the x-axis pointing to the right, the y-axis pointing down, and the z-axis pointing towards the commentator's viewpoint. Use a combination of mathematical formulas and logical operations to develop your template, ensuring it can be applied to various scenarios and array configurations.","response":"To answer this: As a seasoned Japanese sports television commentator, I need to analyze the strategic positioning of players on the field, particularly in a high-stakes soccer match. To accurately assess the team's formation and movement, I must calculate the offset of each player in a multidimensional array that represents the field. Let me think about this carefully. First, I need to understand the structure of the 3D array and how to calculate the offset of an element within it. The array will have dimensions (length, width, height), and each player will have coordinates (x, y, z). Additionally, the array will have a stride (the number of elements between each row, column, and depth level). My goal is to create a template that can handle arrays with varying dimensions and strides, and output the offset in both absolute (index) and relative (distance from the starting point) terms. Let me break down the problem into smaller parts. The first step is to unpack the array dimensions, element coordinates, and array stride. This will help me understand the structure of the array and the position of the element within it. Now, let's think about the formula to calculate the absolute offset (index). The absolute offset can be calculated using the formula: [ text{absolute_offset} = z times (text{length} times text{width} times text{y_stride}) + y times (text{length} times text{x_stride}) + x ] This formula takes into account the array's dimensions and stride to determine the exact position of the element within the array. Next, I need to calculate the relative offset (distance from the starting point). This can be done using the formula: [ text{relative_offset} = (x times text{x_stride}, y times text{y_stride}, z times text{z_stride}) ] This will give me the distance of the element from the starting point in each dimension. Let's put this all together in a template. I'll write a Python function to perform these calculations and output the results. \`\`\`python def calculate_offset(array_dimensions, element_coordinates, array_stride): \\"\\"\\" Calculate the offset of an element in a 3D array. Parameters: array_dimensions (tuple): (length, width, height) of the array element_coordinates (tuple): (x, y, z) coordinates of the element array_stride (tuple): (x_stride, y_stride, z_stride) stride of the array Returns: tuple: (absolute_offset, relative_offset) \\"\\"\\" # Unpack array dimensions, element coordinates, and array stride length, width, height = array_dimensions x, y, z = element_coordinates x_stride, y_stride, z_stride = array_stride # Calculate absolute offset (index) absolute_offset = z * (length * width * y_stride) + y * (length * x_stride) + x # Calculate relative offset (distance from the starting point) relative_offset = (x * x_stride, y * y_stride, z * z_stride) return absolute_offset, relative_offset # Example usage: array_dimensions = (10, 10, 5) # length, width, height element_coordinates = (3, 4, 2) # x, y, z array_stride = (1, 1, 1) # x_stride, y_stride, z_stride absolute_offset, relative_offset = calculate_offset(array_dimensions, element_coordinates, array_stride) print(f\\"Absolute Offset (Index): {absolute_offset}\\") print(f\\"Relative Offset (Distance): {relative_offset}\\") \`\`\` **Explanation** This template calculates the offset of an element in a 3D array by considering the array's dimensions, element coordinates, and array stride. The absolute offset (index) is calculated using a mathematical formula that takes into account the array's dimensions and stride. The relative offset (distance from the starting point) is calculated by multiplying the element's coordinates with the corresponding stride values. The template is designed to handle arrays with varying dimensions and strides, making it applicable to various scenarios and array configurations. The output provides both absolute and relative offsets, allowing for flexible analysis and processing of the array data. **Application in Soccer Match Analysis** In the context of a soccer match, this template can be used to analyze the strategic positioning of players on the field. By representing the field as a 3D array, with the x-axis pointing to the right, the y-axis pointing down, and the z-axis pointing towards the commentator's viewpoint, the template can calculate the offset of each player from the starting point (top-left corner of the field). The absolute offset (index) can be used to identify the player's position in the array, while the relative offset (distance) can be used to analyze the player's movement and positioning relative to the starting point. This information can be valuable in understanding the team's formation and movement, allowing for more accurate analysis and commentary during the match. Wait, let me check the instruction again to ensure I haven't missed anything. Fantastic! After all these calculations, I can confidently say that this template will help me provide insightful commentary on the strategic positioning of players during a high-stakes soccer match.

I need to ensure that the tone balances wit with wisdom, acknowledging the challenges of implementing environmentally conscious practices while maintaining profitability. **Vignette I: The Stakeholder's Dilemma** Let me start with the first vignette. When engaging with stakeholders, remember that their interests are as varied as the threads of a spider's web. Tug on one strand, and the entire tapestry may unravel. The Carbon Trust would have you believe that transparency is key, but beware: too much candor can be a liability. As you dance the delicate ballet of stakeholder management, recall the wise words of the butterfly effect: a single misstep can send ripples through the value chain, leaving your carefully crafted sustainability strategy in tatters. Wait, let me check the instruction again. I need to weave in allusions to the Carbon Trust and industry associations, as well as nods to the intricate relationships between corporate social responsibility, environmental stewardship, and economic viability. This is a key point to emphasize, as it highlights the multifaceted nature of sustainability consulting. **Vignette II: The Supply Chain's Gordian Knot** Now, let's move on to the second vignette. To unravel the complexities of your supply chain, you'll need the patience of a saint and the cunning of a fox. Industry associations will tout the benefits of collaboration, but don't be fooled: in the world of sustainability, cooperation is a luxury few can afford. As you strive for transparency, remember that the pursuit of carbon neutrality is a Sisyphean task. Each incremental gain is offset by the unpredictable whims of a globalized market, where the pursuit of profit often trumps the pursuit of sustainability. Let me break this down a bit more. The supply chain is a critical area where sustainability consultants face significant challenges. The tension between transparency and profit is a real issue, and it's important to highlight this in the narrative. I need to ensure that the tone remains conversational and that the piece is accessible to fellow sustainability experts. **Vignette III: The Sustainability Consultant's Quandary** Next, I'll tackle the third vignette. As a sustainability consultant, you are both catalyst and Cassandra. Your clients will laud your expertise, even as they secretly doubt the wisdom of their own sustainability initiatives. You'll be torn between the competing demands of environmental stewardship and economic viability, forced to navigate the treacherous waters of corporate social responsibility. And yet, it is in this very tension that lies the opportunity for true innovation. Seize it, and you may just find that the pursuit of sustainability becomes the key to unlocking a brighter, more profitable future. Wait, let me think about this a bit more. The role of the sustainability consultant is complex, and it's important to highlight both the opportunities and obstacles inherent in this position. This vignette should serve as a reflection on the challenges and triumphs of integrating sustainability into the fabric of modern business. **Vignette IV: The Butterfly Effect's Unpredictable Implications** Now, let's delve into the fourth vignette. In the world of lean manufacturing, we speak of the \\"butterfly effect\\" in hushed tones, as if it were a dark and ancient magic. But what happens when the butterfly's wings beat in the context of value chain optimization? The answer, much like the butterfly itself, is elusive. One thing is certain, however: the pursuit of sustainability is a high-stakes game of whack-a-mole, where each incremental gain is offset by the unpredictable consequences of a globalized market. And yet, it is in this very unpredictability that lies the opportunity for true innovation. Let me reflect on this for a moment. The butterfly effect is a powerful concept that can be used to illustrate the complex and interconnected nature of sustainability initiatives. It's important to convey this idea in a way that is both insightful and accessible. **Vignette V: The Quest for Carbon Neutrality** Finally, let's address the fifth vignette. Ah, carbon neutrality: the holy grail of sustainability initiatives. But beware, dear consultant, for this quest is fraught with peril. The path to carbon neutrality is a labyrinth of twists and turns, where the slightest misstep can send your entire strategy careening off course. And yet, it is in this very pursuit that lies the opportunity for true greatness. Seize it, and you may just find that the quest for carbon neutrality becomes the key to unlocking a brighter, more sustainable future. Let me think about this for a moment. The pursuit of carbon neutrality is a significant challenge for many companies, and it's important to highlight both the difficulties and the potential rewards. This vignette should serve as a reflection on the complexities of achieving carbon neutrality and the role of sustainability consultants in this process. In conclusion, dear fellow sustainability expert, the world of corporate sustainability is a complex and multifaceted beast. But with wit, wisdom, and a healthy dose of satire, we may just find that the pursuit of sustainability becomes the key to unlocking a brighter, more profitable future.

Final Answer: \\"Ars Sustentia\\""},{"prompt":"As a fitness technology developer, you've been approached by a sports analytics firm to collaborate on a project that combines tennis performance data with AI-driven workout management software. Your task is to create a script in a custom-built scripting language (TennisScript) that generates personalized tennis training routines based on a player's strengths, weaknesses, and past performance data. The script should take into account various factors such as the player's serve speed, volley accuracy, and endurance levels. Additionally, the script should incorporate data on the types of balls used in tennis, including their weight, size, and rebound characteristics. To start, write a medieval-style poem ( minimum 12 lines) that describes the different types of balls used in tennis, including the ITF-approved ball, the Pressurized ball, and the Stage 3 ball. The poem should highlight the unique characteristics of each ball type and their effects on gameplay. The poem should be written in a style reminiscent of Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" and include a P.P.S section that contains a cryptic message related to the scripting language. Once you've completed the poem, use it as a reference to create a TennisScript function that generates a customized tennis training routine based on the player's performance data and the characteristics of the ball used. The function should take the following inputs: - Player's serve speed (mph) - Player's volley accuracy (%) - Player's endurance level (high, medium, low) - Ball type (ITF-approved, Pressurized, Stage 3) The function should output a training routine that includes a combination of drills and exercises tailored to the player's strengths and weaknesses, as well as the characteristics of the ball used. Finally, test the function using sample player data and ball characteristics, and provide a written explanation of how the script generates the customized training routine and how it can be used to improve a player's performance.","response":"To answer this, I need to craft a thoughtful response that reflects a deep understanding of the task at hand.

Now, let me craft the poem: In days of yore, when courts were set and balls did fly, In tennis realms, a tale of three balls doth lie. The ITF-approved, a standard of might, Weighs 2.57 ounces, a size most fair and bright. Its rebound, a bounce of moderate pace, Doth test the player's skill and steady hand's embrace. The Pressurized ball, a marvel of modern art, Doth boast a higher bounce, a faster heart. Its internal pressure, a secret to its might, Doth challenge players to react with speed and light. Its weight, a fraction less, doth make it swift, A ball of choice for those who dare to shift. The Stage 3 ball, a ball of lesser bounce, Doth suit the younger players, with a gentler trounce. Its weight, a fraction more, doth make it slow, A ball of choice for those who need to grow. P.P.S. \\"In TennisScript, the 'Ball' class doth hold the key, To unlock the secrets of the game, and set the players free.\\" Now, let me move on to creating the TennisScript function. I need to define the ball characteristics and the training drills based on the player's performance data. Then, I'll generate a customized training routine that takes into account the player's strengths, weaknesses, and the ball characteristics. Let me think about how to structure the function: 1. Define ball characteristics. 2. Define training drills based on player's performance data. 3. Generate customized training routine based on player's performance data and ball characteristics. Let me start coding the TennisScript function: \`\`\`tennisscript function generateTrainingRoutine(serveSpeed, volleyAccuracy, enduranceLevel, ballType) { // Define ball characteristics ballCharacteristics = { \\"ITF-approved\\": {weight: 2.57, size: \\"standard\\", rebound: \\"moderate\\"}, \\"Pressurized\\": {weight: 2.55, size: \\"standard\\", rebound: \\"high\\"}, \\"Stage 3\\": {weight: 2.60, size: \\"standard\\", rebound: \\"low\\"} } // Define training drills based on player's performance data trainingDrills = { \\"serve\\": { \\"high\\": [\\"Power Serve Drill\\", \\"Slice Serve Drill\\"], \\"medium\\": [\\"Basic Serve Drill\\", \\"Topspin Serve Drill\\"], \\"low\\": [\\"Serve Technique Drill\\", \\"Serve Consistency Drill\\"] }, \\"volley\\": { \\"high\\": [\\"Volley Accuracy Drill\\", \\"Volley Footwork Drill\\"], \\"medium\\": [\\"Basic Volley Drill\\", \\"Volley Technique Drill\\"], \\"low\\": [\\"Volley Consistency Drill\\", \\"Volley Recovery Drill\\"] }, \\"endurance\\": { \\"high\\": [\\"Agility Ladder Drill\\", \\"Pro Agility Shuttle Drill\\"], \\"medium\\": [\\"Basic Endurance Drill\\", \\"Interval Training Drill\\"], \\"low\\": [\\"Endurance Technique Drill\\", \\"Endurance Consistency Drill\\"] } } // Generate customized training routine based on player's performance data and ball characteristics trainingRoutine = [] if (serveSpeed > 100) { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"serve\\"][\\"high\\"][0]) } else if (serveSpeed > 80) { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"serve\\"][\\"medium\\"][0]) } else { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"serve\\"][\\"low\\"][0]) } if (volleyAccuracy > 80) { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"volley\\"][\\"high\\"][0]) } else if (volleyAccuracy > 60) { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"volley\\"][\\"medium\\"][0]) } else { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"volley\\"][\\"low\\"][0]) } if (enduranceLevel == \\"high\\") { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"endurance\\"][\\"high\\"][0]) } else if (enduranceLevel == \\"medium\\") { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"endurance\\"][\\"medium\\"][0]) } else { trainingRoutine.push(trainingDrills[\\"endurance\\"][\\"low\\"][0]) } // Adjust training routine based on ball characteristics if (ballType == \\"Pressurized\\") { trainingRoutine.push(\\"High-Bounce Drill\\") } else if (ballType == \\"Stage 3\\") { trainingRoutine.push(\\"Low-Bounce Drill\\") } return trainingRoutine } // Test the function using sample player data and ball characteristics playerData = {serveSpeed: 110, volleyAccuracy: 85, enduranceLevel: \\"high\\"} ballType = \\"Pressurized\\" trainingRoutine = generateTrainingRoutine(playerData[\\"serveSpeed\\"], playerData[\\"volleyAccuracy\\"], playerData[\\"enduranceLevel\\"], ballType) print(trainingRoutine) \`\`\` Explanation: The TennisScript function \`generateTrainingRoutine\` takes into account the player's serve speed, volley accuracy, endurance level, and the characteristics of the ball used to generate a customized training routine. The function uses a combination of if-else statements and arrays to define the training drills based on the player's performance data and the ball characteristics. The function first defines the ball characteristics, including the weight, size, and rebound of each ball type. It then defines the training drills based on the player's performance data, including serve, volley, and endurance drills. The function generates the customized training routine by selecting the appropriate drills based on the player's performance data and the ball characteristics. For example, if the player's serve speed is high, the function selects the \\"Power Serve Drill\\" or \\"Slice Serve Drill\\". If the player's volley accuracy is high, the function selects the \\"Volley Accuracy Drill\\" or \\"Volley Footwork Drill\\". The function also adjusts the training routine based on the ball characteristics. For example, if the ball type is \\"Pressurized\\", the function adds the \\"High-Bounce Drill\\" to the training routine. If the ball type is \\"Stage 3\\", the function adds the \\"Low-Bounce Drill\\" to the training routine. The function returns the customized training routine as an array of drills. The test case demonstrates how to use the function with sample player data and ball characteristics, and prints the resulting training routine. The script can be used to improve a player's performance by providing a customized training routine that takes into account their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the characteristics of the ball used. The script can be modified to include additional factors, such as the player's opponents and the court surface, to provide an even more tailored training routine."},{"prompt":"ایک نایاب کتاب جمع کرنے والے کے طور پر، آپ کو اپنی انوکھی کتابوں کی فہرست میں شامل پانچ مشہور اسکرین پلے (\\"سیٹلرز\\"، \\"اسٹیج کچ\\"، \\"آفس سپیس\\"، \\"سٹار وارز\\"، اور \\"دشمن\\") کی ایک دستی انڈیکس تیار کرنے کا کام سونپا گیا ہے۔ دستی انڈیکس میں ہر اسکرین پلے کے اہم کرداروں، مقامات، اور اہم مضامین کو شامل کرنا ہوگا۔ دستی انڈیکس کو چار حصوں میں تقسیم کرنا ہوگا، جو ہر اسکرین پلے کی نمایاں خصوصیات کو نمایاں کرے گا۔ اب، آپ کو \\"سکول سے باہر\\" کے عنوان سے ایک اضافی حصہ شامل کرنا ہوگا، جس میں آپ کے دو دوستوں کے درمیان ایک مکالمہ ہوگا جو \\"ہوم اسکولنگ کے راز: واضح!\\" کے عنوان سے ایک نئی کتاب کا جائزہ لے رہے ہیں۔ مکالمہ اردو میں ہونا چاہئے اور اس میں کتاب کے مضامین، کرداروں، اور مضامین کا جائزہ لینا ہوگا۔ آپ کو مکالمے میں شامل کرنے کے لیے پانچ سو الفاظ کا WORD LIMIT ہے۔","response":"\\"To answer this, I need to create a detailed index for five famous screenplays: \\"The Settlers,\\" \\"Stage Kitchens,\\" \\"Off Space,\\" \\"Star Wars,\\" and \\"Enemy.\\" The index should include significant characters, locations, and themes from each screenplay.

Let me break down the requirements and think through each step. First, I'll start with the introduction. Let me check the key points again: the Social Credit Party's significance, its rise during the Great Depression, and its impact on Alberta's political landscape. I need to make sure the introduction is engaging and sets the stage for the Q&As. **Introduction** The Social Credit Party played a pivotal role in shaping Alberta's political landscape during the 1930s to 1940s. Emerging as a response to the economic hardships of the Great Depression, the party's unique blend of populist and conservative ideologies resonated with many Albertans. Under the leadership of William Aberhart and later Ernest Manning, the Social Credit Party implemented significant policies that transformed the province's economy, education system, and social welfare programs. This study guide delves into the party's ideology, notable leaders, and major controversies, providing a comprehensive understanding of the Social Credit Party's impact on Alberta's political history. Now, let me move on to the Q&As. I need to ensure that each question is open-ended and thought-provoking, encouraging critical thinking and analysis. Let me think about the first Q&A. **Q & A # 1** *** What were the key factors that contributed to the rise of the Social Credit Party in Alberta during the 1930s, and how did the party's ideology address the economic concerns of the time? The Social Credit Party's rise to power in Alberta during the 1930s can be attributed to the province's economic struggles, widespread poverty, and discontent with the existing political establishment. The party's ideology, based on the theories of C.H. Douglas, emphasized the need for economic reform, social justice, and government intervention in the economy. The party's promise to provide a monthly dividend to citizens, known as the \\"Basic Dividend,\\" resonated with many Albertans who were struggling to make ends meet. Wait, let me break this down further. I need to ensure the answer is concise yet detailed, providing relevant historical context and supporting evidence. I'll also need to incorporate at least two questions that require the application of historical concepts, such as the impact of the Great Depression on Alberta's politics or the role of Ernest Manning in shaping the party's ideology. **Q & A # 2** *** Analyze the significance of William Aberhart's leadership in shaping the Social Credit Party's ideology and policies. How did his background and beliefs influence the party's direction? William Aberhart, a Baptist minister and radio evangelist, played a crucial role in shaping the Social Credit Party's ideology and policies. His background in theology and his experience as a radio broadcaster helped him connect with ordinary Albertans and articulate the party's message. Aberhart's leadership emphasized the importance of social justice, economic reform, and government accountability. His commitment to the party's ideology and his ability to communicate complex ideas in simple terms helped build a loyal following and establish the Social Credit Party as a major force in Alberta politics. Now, I need to focus on a primary source, such as a speech or letter from a prominent Social Credit leader, and ask students to analyze the content and significance of the document. Let me think about which primary source to use. **Q & A # 3** *** Examine the impact of the Great Depression on Alberta's politics and the rise of the Social Credit Party. How did the party's policies address the economic challenges faced by the province during this period? The Great Depression had a devastating impact on Alberta's economy, leading to widespread poverty, unemployment, and discontent with the existing political establishment. The Social Credit Party's policies, such as the Basic Dividend and the establishment of the Alberta Treasury Branches, aimed to address the economic challenges faced by the province. The party's emphasis on government intervention in the economy and its commitment to social welfare programs helped alleviate some of the suffering caused by the Depression. However, the party's policies were not without controversy, and the implementation of the Basic Dividend, in particular, was met with resistance from the federal government. Wait, let me check the next Q&A. I need to include a question that focuses on a primary source, such as William Aberhart's 1935 speech, \\"The Social Credit Movement in Alberta.\\" **Q & A # 4** *** Analyze the content and significance of William Aberhart's 1935 speech, \\"The Social Credit Movement in Alberta.\\" What insights does the speech provide into the party's ideology and policies? William Aberhart's 1935 speech, \\"The Social Credit Movement in Alberta,\\" provides valuable insights into the party's ideology and policies. In the speech, Aberhart outlines the party's commitment to social justice, economic reform, and government accountability. He emphasizes the need for a more equitable distribution of wealth and the importance of government intervention in the economy. The speech also highlights the party's focus on education and social welfare programs, demonstrating Aberhart's commitment to building a more just and compassionate society. Finally, I need to address the major controversies surrounding the Social Credit Party's governance in Alberta and how these controversies impacted the party's legacy. **Q & A # 5** *** What were the major controversies surrounding the Social Credit Party's governance in Alberta, and how did these controversies impact the party's legacy? The Social Credit Party's governance in Alberta was marked by several controversies, including the party's attempts to implement the Basic Dividend, the establishment of the Alberta Treasury Branches, and the party's handling of the province's finances. The party's policies were often at odds with the federal government, leading to tensions and conflicts between the two levels of government. The controversies surrounding the party's governance have had a lasting impact on the party's legacy, with some historians viewing the party as a pioneering force in social welfare and economic reform, while others see it as a populist movement that undermined the principles of responsible government. To further enhance the study guide, I need to include a list of 5 recommended readings or resources for further study. Let me check the sources again. **Recommended Readings:** 1. Aberhart, W.

Begin by creating a list of the average length of at least 10 different animal specimens, ranging from the smallest (e.g., fairyfly) to the largest (e.g., blue whale). Organize this list in a table format, including columns for the animal's name, average length, and any relevant biological or environmental characteristics that may influence its symbolism in dreams (e.g., nocturnal/ diurnal, predator/ prey, etc.). Next, draw upon your knowledge of lucid dreaming and Jungian analytical psychology to speculate on how the size and characteristics of these animals may correspond to different aspects of the subconscious mind. Consider how the smallest animals might represent the minutest details of one's thoughts or emotions, while the largest animals could symbolize the most profound and overwhelming aspects of the self. Using this framework, analyze a selection of personal lucid dreaming experiences or those documented in research studies, and attempt to correlate the appearance of specific animals with the themes, emotions, or insights that emerged during the dream. Discuss the potential implications of these findings for the field of lucid dreaming research and the role of symbolism in personal growth and self-discovery. Your response should contain less than 17 sentences and include the initial list of animal specimens, as well as any relevant tables or diagrams to support your analysis.","response":"To answer this, let me first organize the information in a thoughtful manner, reflecting on the relationship between the average length of various animal specimens and their potential symbolic representation in lucid dreaming experiences. First, I need to create a list of at least 10 different animal specimens, ranging from the smallest to the largest, along with their average lengths and relevant biological or environmental characteristics. This will help me understand how these animals might symbolize different aspects of the subconscious mind in lucid dreams. **Table: Animal Specimens and Characteristics** | Animal | Average Length | Characteristics | |--------------|----------------|---------------------------| | Fairyfly | 0.2 mm | Nocturnal, parasitic | | Fruit Fly | 3-4 mm | Diurnal, attracted to sweet substances | | Honey Bee | 12-15 mm | Diurnal, social, industrious | | Hummingbird | 7-13 cm | Diurnal, iridescent feathers | | Mouse | 15-20 cm | Nocturnal, prey animal | | Snake | 1-3 meters | Nocturnal, predator | | Cat | 40-60 cm | Nocturnal, predator | | Deer | 1.5-2 meters | Diurnal, prey animal | | Lion | 2-3 meters | Diurnal, predator | | Elephant | 3-4 meters | Diurnal, social, intelligent | | Blue Whale | 25-30 meters | Diurnal, filter feeder | Now, let's consider the symbolic representation of these animals in lucid dreaming experiences. Smaller animals, like fairyflies, might represent the minutest details of one's thoughts or emotions, while larger animals, like blue whales, could symbolize the most profound and overwhelming aspects of the self. Let me think about how the characteristics of these animals might influence their symbolism. For example, the nocturnal nature of the fairyfly and the mouse might symbolize hidden or subconscious thoughts, while the diurnal nature of the elephant and blue whale might represent more overt or conscious aspects of the self. In one documented lucid dreaming experience, a dreamer encountered a snake, which represented a fear of being overwhelmed by their emotions. The snake's nocturnal nature and predatory characteristics may have symbolized the dreamer's unconscious fear of being consumed by their emotions. In contrast, a dreamer who encountered a hummingbird reported feeling a sense of joy and wonder. The hummingbird's iridescent feathers and diurnal nature may have symbolized the dreamer's desire for beauty and positivity in their waking life. Wait a minute, let me summarize the implications of these findings. These preliminary observations suggest that the size and characteristics of animals in lucid dreaming experiences may be correlated with specific themes, emotions, or insights. Further research is needed to fully explore the relationship between animal symbolism and the subconscious mind. However, these findings have implications for the field of lucid dreaming research and the role of symbolism in personal growth and self-discovery. Final Answer: The analysis of animal symbolism in lucid dreaming experiences reveals that the size and characteristics of animals can represent different aspects of the subconscious mind. Smaller animals like fairyflies and fruit flies may symbolize minute details of thoughts or emotions, while larger animals like blue whales and elephants may symbolize profound and overwhelming aspects of the self. These findings have implications for the field of lucid dreaming research and the role of symbolism in personal growth and self-discovery."},{"prompt":"instruction: as a research administrator at the

I got separated from my family, and I found myself *feeling scared and alone* in a world that seemed too big and too loud. Let me think about this carefully. What does it mean to lose everything you know? It means starting over, and that's what I had to do. I wandered the streets, searching for food and shelter. I had to *scavenge for scraps* and avoid the dangers that lurked in every alleyway. My belly growled with hunger, and I *experienced pangs of hunger* that made my stomach ache. I missed my family's warm touch and the comfort of our cozy home. Wait, let me break this down first - what does it mean to be hungry and scared? It means you're vulnerable, and you need to be extra cautious. As I explored the neighborhood, I met other animals who had also lost their way. There was a stray dog who had been living on the streets for months, and a bird who had fallen out of its nest. We formed a little community, and for a while, we *found comfort in each other's company*. But I knew I couldn't stay with them forever. I needed to find a new home, a new family. Let me check - what does it mean to find a new home? It means finding a place where you belong, and I was determined to do just that. One day, I met a little girl named Maria. She lived in a small apartment with her mother and siblings. They didn't have much, but they had a big heart. Maria took me in, fed me, and gave me a warm bed to sleep in. At first, I was *skeptical of her kindness*, but as the days went by, I *developed a sense of trust*. Maria was different from the other humans I had met. She was gentle, patient, and understanding. Let me think about this - how does trust form? It takes time, and it's built on consistent kindness and care. But Maria had her own struggles. She often *stayed up late at night, worrying about her family's problems*. Her mother worked two jobs, and her siblings were always fighting. Maria felt overwhelmed, and *her lack of sleep made her irritable*. I could sense her stress, and I knew I had to be patient with her. Wait a minute - how does one cope with stress? It's a challenge, but it's about finding small moments of peace and comfort. As the days turned into weeks, Maria and I became inseparable. We would cuddle on the couch, and I would purr softly to calm her down. She would talk to me about her problems, and I would listen attentively. I *felt a sense of purpose*, knowing that I was helping Maria cope with her emotions. Let me break this down - how does one feel a sense of purpose? It comes from knowing that you're making a difference, even in a small way. But I still had my own struggles. I *had trouble sleeping* at night, haunted by memories of my old family. I would wake up in the middle of the night, *feeling anxious and scared*. Maria would comfort me, stroking my fur and whispering softly in my ear. Slowly but surely, I began to *establish a new routine*, learning to cope with stress and find peace in my new home. Let me think - how does one establish a new routine? It's about finding a new rhythm and sticking to it. Maria's family was struggling, but they never gave up. They worked together, supported each other, and found ways to make ends meet. I learned from them that *community support is key* during difficult times. They showed me that even in the darkest moments, there is always hope. Let me check - what does it mean to have hope? It means believing that things will get better, even when it seems impossible. As I look back on my journey, I realize that losing my family was not the end of the world. It was a new beginning, a chance to find a new home and a new sense of belonging. I *found a new family in Maria and her loved ones*, and I will always be grateful for their love and support. Let me think - what does it mean to find a new family? It means finding a new source of love and comfort. To all the animals and children out there who are struggling, I want to say that there is hope. You are not alone, and you are not forgotten. *Hold on to hope*, and never give up. With community support and self-care, you can overcome even the toughest challenges. Let me check - what does it mean to hold on to hope? It means never giving up, even when things seem impossible. Final Answer: My story is one of loss and belonging, of finding hope and community support in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"Write a plot for a story about two people who swap fingerprints.

In your story include a scene where the equity trader has to navigate a digital asset trading platform using the rising star's fingerprints and another scene where the rising star tries to make a traditional stock market trade using the equity trader's fingerprints. Analyze how their different skills and knowledge affect their ability to adapt to the new fingerprint and vice versa. Explore the tension and conflict that arises from this swap and how it ultimately leads to a change in their perspectives on their respective markets.","response":"To answer this: <<The Fingerprint Paradox>> Let me start by setting the scene. In a world where fingerprint recognition is the primary method of authentication in both traditional and digital financial markets, two individuals, James Reed and Alex Chen, find themselves in an unexpected situation. James, a seasoned equity trader, is initially reluctant to adapt to digital assets, seeing them as a fad. Alex, on the other hand, is a rising star in the digital asset market, overconfident in his ability to predict market shifts. One day, at a financial conference, James and Alex engage in a heated debate about the merits of traditional versus digital assets. In a moment of jest, they decide to swap fingerprints as a way of proving whose market is superior. The fingerprint swap is done using a high-tech device that can transfer and replicate fingerprints with perfect accuracy. At first, they think nothing of the swap, but soon they realize that their fingerprints are now linked to each other's accounts and trading platforms. Let me think about James's situation first. James is forced to navigate a digital asset trading platform using Alex's fingerprints. He is unfamiliar with the platform and struggles to make sense of the complex cryptocurrency market. Wait, let me break this down - James has to adapt to a completely new system. He makes a series of rookie mistakes and loses a significant amount of money. This must be incredibly frustrating for him. Now, let's consider Alex's perspective. Alex tries to make a traditional stock market trade using James's fingerprints. He is equally out of his depth and fails to understand the nuances of the traditional market. He makes a series of ill-advised trades and loses a substantial amount of money. This must be a humbling experience for Alex, who was so confident in his abilities. As the days go by, James and Alex realize that the fingerprint swap has compromised more than just their trading abilities. They start to experience strange occurrences - James receives emails meant for Alex and vice versa. They begin to suspect that their identities have been compromised. Wait, this is getting serious. They need to figure out what's going on. A sudden market shift affects both James and Alex. A major cryptocurrency crashes, and the traditional stock market experiences a sharp downturn. James and Alex are forced to work together to navigate the chaos and recover their losses. This must be a tense moment for them, especially given their initial rivalry. As they work together, James and Alex begin to see the value in each other's markets. James develops a new appreciation for the potential of digital assets, while Alex learns to respect the stability of the traditional market. This realization is crucial for their growth and understanding. In the end, James and Alex manage to recover their losses and reverse the fingerprint swap. However, they emerge from the experience with a newfound respect for each other's expertise and a broader understanding of the financial markets. The twist is that the fingerprint swap was not the only thing that had been compromised. A rogue trader had hacked into the device that transferred their fingerprints and had been manipulating their trades from behind the scenes. James and Alex realize that they had been pawns in a larger game and that their swap had been just a small part of a larger scheme. The experience leaves James and Alex shaken but also wiser. They emerge from the ordeal with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of the financial markets and a deeper understanding of the importance of adaptability and humility. Final Answer: <<The Fingerprint Paradox>>"},{"prompt":"As a cryptography researcher with a strong background in number theory, you have been invited to present a lecture on the applications of cryptographic techniques in historical data analysis at an upcoming international conference.

The audience will consist of experts in cryptography, number theory, and Japanese history.","response":"To answer this, I need to carefully craft a presentation that not only covers the history of Japan but also integrates cryptographic techniques in a meaningful way. Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to summarize the history of Japan, focusing on the *Muromachi Shogunate*, the *Tokugawa Shogunate*, and the *Meiji Restoration*. This will be the foundation of my presentation, providing the necessary historical context. *Let me think about this carefully. The Muromachi Shogunate was marked by the rise of the *Samurai* and the *Daimyo*, while the Tokugawa Shogunate was characterized by a rigid social hierarchy and the isolationist policy of *Sakoku*. The Meiji Restoration, on the other hand, marked the restoration of imperial rule and the modernization of Japan.* Next, I need to create a cryptographic hash function using a prime number greater than 7 as the modulus. This function should be efficient and precise, taking into account the *birthday problem*. I'll start with a simple quadratic function and use a prime modulus to ensure the hash is unique and secure. *Wait, let me break this down. The hash function should be designed to encrypt key events in Japanese history. A simple quadratic function like ( h(x) = (x^2 + 3x + 7) mod 11 ) could work. But I need to ensure it's efficient and precise. The modulus 11 is a prime number, which should help in reducing collisions.* Now, I need to develop a *Vigenère cipher* to encode the names of prominent historical figures. The cipher should use a keyword related to Japanese culture, such as *Sakura* or *Bushido*. This will add an interesting layer to the presentation, showing how historical names can be encoded and decoded. *Let me check the details on this. The Vigenère cipher can be represented as ( C = (P + K) mod 26 ), where ( C ) is the ciphertext, ( P ) is the plaintext, and ( K ) is the keyword. For example, encoding \\"Tokugawa Ieyasu\\" with the keyword \\"Sakura\\" would yield a unique ciphertext.* I also need to analyze the frequency distribution of characters in Japanese historical texts and create a histogram to visualize the results. This will help demonstrate the effectiveness of the Vigenère cipher. *Wait a minute, let me think about this. The frequency distribution of characters in Japanese texts can be visualized using a histogram. This will show the most common characters and how the Vigenère cipher affects the distribution.* The summary of Japan's history should be concise and precise, italicizing at least 5 keywords. This will help emphasize the key concepts and make the presentation more engaging. *Let me think about the keywords. The summary should include terms like *Samurai*, *Shogun*, *Daimyo*, *Ronin*, and *Kamikaze*. These terms are crucial to understanding the historical context and the social structures of Japan.* Incorporating images and diagrams will be essential to illustrate the cryptographic techniques and historical events. The color scheme should prominently feature the color green to maintain a cohesive look. *Let me check the images and diagrams. I can use images of traditional Japanese gardens and scrolls, with a green color scheme to tie everything together.* Finally, I need to write a reflection on the intersection of cryptography and historical data analysis. This should discuss the potential applications and limitations of using cryptographic techniques in historical research. *Let me think about this. Cryptography can reveal new insights into historical events, but it requires careful consideration of the context and cultural significance of the data.

Furthermore, the plan should outline strategies for community engagement, volunteer management, and collaboration with local schools to ensure the trail's long-term maintenance and educational value. Submit the plan in a clear, concise report, complete with visuals and a detailed implementation timeline.","response":"To answer this, I need to develop a comprehensive plan for creating a community-led, eco-friendly linguistic trail through the parish's natural reserves and heritage sites, focusing on the unique sounds and structures of the Ukrainian language, specifically its morphology. Let me break down the requirements and think through this step-by-step. **Step 1: Understanding the Requirements** The plan should consist of two main components: 1. A 200-word article about the morphology of the Ukrainian language, ensuring the letter 'c' appears at least 60 times. 2. A detailed, 5-kilometer trail map with 10 designated stops, each featuring an interpretive sign showcasing a distinct aspect of Ukrainian morphology. **Step 2: Drafting the Article on Ukrainian Morphology** Let me think about how to craft this article. The Ukrainian language's morphology is characterized by a copious collection of cases, conjugations, and declensions. Conveniently, Ukrainian's case system consists of seven cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative, and vocative. Carefully crafted case endings, such as -а, -и, -у, and -ові, cleverly convey grammatical function. Conjugating verbs, like читати (to read), involves clever combinations of prefixes, roots, and suffixes, creating a captivating cascade of cognates. Conversely, noun declension, as seen in words like місто (city), demonstrates a clear-cut connection between case and context. Creative combinations of consonant and vowel clusters create a characteristic cadence, crafting a captivating, culturally rich language. Conversely, Ukrainian's consonant and vowel patterns, such as the use of ц, ч, and ш, contribute to its distinct character. Clearly, the language's complex morphology is a crucial component of its unique cultural identity. Consequently, this linguistic trail aims to creatively showcase Ukrainian's captivating complexities, cultivating a deeper connection between community members and the natural environment. **Step 3: Designing the Trail Map and Interpretive Signs** Now, let me design the trail map and interpretive signs. The 5-kilometer trail will feature 10 designated stops, each highlighting a distinct aspect of Ukrainian morphology.

Ensure the paragraph is 100-150 words, written in a formal tone suitable for an academic paper, and includes at least two technical terms related to string processing. Additionally, determine the longest palindromic substring within the recreated sentence using the Manacher algorithm and highlight it in the paragraph. The recreated sentence should be a standalone sentence and not part of a list or quotation. Finally, analyze the time complexity of the Manacher algorithm and provide a brief explanation of how it achieves linear time complexity despite the presence of nested loops in its implementation.","response":"To answer this, let me first rephrase the sentence \\"A bust of a man with a beard and mustache\\" into a more sophisticated form: \\"An intricately carved bust of a distinguished gentleman, replete with facial hair, including both a beard and a mustache, graced the desk.\\" Now, let me delve into the optimization techniques employed in the Manacher algorithm, which is renowned for its efficiency in identifying the longest palindromic substring within a string in linear time, O(n). The algorithm ingeniously utilizes dynamic programming principles to avoid redundant computations. Initially, I'll preprocess the input string by inserting special characters between each character and at the boundaries, transforming the problem into one where the longest palindromic substring can be found more efficiently. This transformation ensures that every palindrome has a unique center, simplifying the expansion process. Let me think about the longest palindromic substring within the sentence \\"An intricately carved bust of a distinguished gentleman, replete with facial hair, including both a beard and a mustache, graced the desk.\\" Using the Manacher algorithm, I find that the longest palindromic substring is \\"a\\". This discovery is made possible by the algorithm's ability to expand around the center of potential palindromes, leveraging previously computed information to minimize redundant checks. Now, let me analyze how the Manacher algorithm achieves linear time complexity despite having nested loops. The key lies in the preprocessing step and the dynamic programming approach. By storing the lengths of palindromes centered at each position, the algorithm can avoid recalculating these values, thus ensuring that each character is processed in constant time on average. This clever optimization is the cornerstone of the algorithm's efficiency, enabling it to handle large strings effectively. In summary, the Manacher algorithm exemplifies the power of dynamic programming and preprocessing in string processing, efficiently identifying the longest palindromic substring with a time complexity of O(n)."},{"prompt":"As an administrative staff member at Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences, you are tasked with creating content for the university's website that highlights the international opportunities available to students.

The concept is \\"orthogonal frequency-division multiple access\\" (OFDMA), a technology used in modern wireless communication systems. Imagine you are describing OFDMA to a 10-year-old who has a basic understanding of how radio waves work. However, this child has also shown an interest in fantasy novels, particularly J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Given this context and the child's interests, determine whether using an analogy involving the Council of Elrond, where multiple members (representing users) need to communicate with each other (transmit data) simultaneously without interfering with one another, would be an effective way to explain OFDMA. Please provide your answer, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<your answer>>, considering the following factors: 1. The child's familiarity with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and how it can be leveraged to explain a complex technical concept. 2. The limitations of using an analogy to explain a technical concept, particularly one as complex as OFDMA. 3. The potential benefits of using a relatable, story-based approach to explain a difficult idea to a young audience. Your response should demonstrate an understanding of the technical concept, as well as the ability to adapt complex information for a younger audience.","response":"To answer this, let me think about how to effectively explain OFDMA to a 10-year-old who loves \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" I need to find a way to make this complex technical concept relatable and understandable. First, let me break down what OFDMA is. It's a technology used in modern wireless communication systems that allows multiple users to transmit data over the same wireless channel without causing interference. This is achieved by dividing the channel into smaller, non-overlapping sub-channels, or sub-carriers, each of which can carry data from a different user. Now, let me consider how to relate this to the Council of Elrond. The Council of Elrond is a meeting where multiple members need to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other. This is a perfect analogy for OFDMA because it involves multiple parties (users) transmitting information (data) over a shared resource (wireless channel) without causing confusion (interference). Let me think about how to explain this analogy to a child. Imagine the Council of Elrond as a big meeting where many members, like Gandalf, Frodo, and Aragorn, need to share their thoughts and plans. In a regular meeting, one person would speak at a time, but in this special council, they all need to talk at the same time. To avoid confusion, they agree to speak in different 'tones' or 'voices' so that each member's message can be clearly heard by everyone else. This is exactly how OFDMA works. Multiple users are assigned specific 'tones' or sub-carriers within a larger wireless channel. This allows them to transmit data simultaneously without interfering with each other, much like the members of the Council of Elrond communicating in their unique 'tones.' The 'tones' are carefully arranged to be 'orthogonal,' meaning they don't overlap or interfere with each other, ensuring that each user's data is transmitted efficiently and reliably. Now, let me consider the limitations of using this analogy. While it can help a child understand the basic concept of OFDMA, it's important to note that analogies have their limits. They can't capture all the technical details and complexities of the actual technology. However, using a relatable, story-based approach can be a great starting point to introduce the fundamental principles of OFDMA. Wait, let me think about the potential benefits. By leveraging the child's familiarity with \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" I can make the concept more engaging and memorable. This approach can help the child grasp the basic idea and build a foundation for understanding more complex technical details as they become more interested and curious about the subject. In conclusion, using the Council of Elrond analogy can be an effective way to explain OFDMA to a 10-year-old who loves \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" It provides a relatable and engaging starting point that can be expanded upon as the child's understanding grows. <<Using an analogy involving the Council of Elrond to explain OFDMA can be an effective way to introduce this complex technical concept to a 10-year-old familiar with \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" The Council of Elrond, where multiple members need to communicate simultaneously without interfering with each other, can be likened to multiple users (e.g., phones, computers) transmitting data over the same wireless channel without causing interference.
