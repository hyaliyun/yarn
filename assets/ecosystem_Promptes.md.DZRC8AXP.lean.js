ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI that is designed to simulate human-like conversation and can generate responses to a wide range of topics and questions.</p><p>As you might imagine, a system with that kind of intelligence has already shown value in a wide array of industries. Fields like law, psychotherapy, programming, and more have already been impacted, and we are sure to see even greater impacts in the coming months and years.</p><p>But what about marketing? Well, the written word is a crucial component to so many facets of marketing, from blogging, to copywriting, to SEO, online advertising, and much more. And not only can ChatGPT generate intelligent text in a heartbeat, but it can also generate intelligent ideas. And ideas are the lifeblood of marketing.</p><p>But here’s the thing: you can’t generate ideas or text that will help you market your business without a prompt. That’s exactly what we’re here to talk about. Today, I’m going to roll through 20 awesome ChatGPT prompts that you can use in a variety of marketing disciplines.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents" tabindex="-1">Table of Contents <a class="header-anchor" href="#table-of-contents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Table of Contents&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="#what-is-a-chatgpt-prompt">What is a ChatGPT Prompt</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-write-an-effective-prompt-for-chatgpt">How to Write an Effective Prompt for ChatGPT</a></li><li><a href="#chatgpt-prompts-for-social-media">ChatGPT Prompts for Social Media</a></li><li><a href="#chatgpt-prompts-for-email-marketing">ChatGPT Prompts for Email Marketing</a></li><li><a href="#chatgpt-prompts-for-seo">ChatGPT Prompts for SEO</a></li><li><a href="#chatgpt-prompts-for-copywriting">ChatGPT Prompts for Copywriting</a></li></ul><h2 id="what-is-a-chatgpt-prompt" tabindex="-1">What is a ChatGPT Prompt <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-chatgpt-prompt" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a ChatGPT Prompt&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A ChatGPT prompt is any text that you give ChatGPT in order to elicit the response that you want.</p><p>In order to get the most out of ChatGPT, you need to treat it as if it were a human assistant.

Filtering for Tone&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Tone is one of these aspects of copywriting that’s difficult to master. Oftentimes, you’ll have the core of what you’re trying to convey, but you’ll say to yourself: How can I make this friendlier? Smarter? More approachable?
