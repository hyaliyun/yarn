Я понимаю, что это психологическая проблема. Помоги пожалуйста мне ее решить. Может быть дашь какие-нибудь советы или рекомендации","response":"Конечно, я постараюсь помочь. Важно помнить, что управление временем - это навык, который требует практики и терпения, чтобы его освоить. Ваше желание улучшить этот аспект уже является большим шагом вперед. Давайте посмотрим на несколько практических советов, которые могут помочь вам лучше организовать свое время и сделать ваш день более продуктивным. # 1. Поставьте четкие цели - **Краткосрочные и долгосрочные цели.** Очертите, что вы хотите достичь в ближайшие дни, недели и месяцы. Это поможет сфокусироваться на важных задачах. - **SMART-цели.** Убедитесь, что ваши цели конкретные, измеримые, достижимые, реалистичные и временно ограниченные. # 2. Планирование - **Ежедневный и еженедельный план.** Вечером напишите список задач на следующий день и распределите задачи по приоритетам на неделю. - **Ограничивайте список задач.** Не перегружайте себя; оставьте время на непредвиденные дела и отдых. # 3. Осваивайте техники управления временем - **Метод Pomodoro.** Работайте 25 минут, затем делайте 5-минутный перерыв. После каждого четвертого цикла делайте более длинный перерыв. - **Метод двух минут.** Если задача занимает меньше двух минут, сделайте её сразу. - **Правило 80/20.** Помните, что 20% усилий часто приносят 80% результата. Сосредоточьтесь на самых важных задачах. # 4. Отслеживание времени - **Используйте таймеры и приложения.** Это поможет вам оставаться в рамках отведенного времени на задачу. - **Ведите дневник времени.** Записывайте, сколько времени занимает выполнение разных действий, чтобы лучше планировать будущие задачи. # 5. Избегайте многозадачности - Сосредоточьтесь на одной задаче за раз. Многозадачность часто ведет к снижению качества и увеличению времени на выполнение работы. # 6. Учитесь говорить \\"Нет\\" - Оценивайте, как задачи соотносятся с вашими целями и приоритетами, прежде чем браться за них. # 7. Создайте подходящую рабочую среду - Убедитесь, что ваше рабочее место комфортно и минимизирует отвлечения. # 8. Заботьтесь о себе - Полноценный сон, здоровое питание, физические упражнения и регулярные перерывы повышают эффективность и благополучие. # В заключение Не забывайте, что каждый человек уникален. Экспериментируйте с разными стратегиями и находите то, что лучше всего подходит именно вам. Не стесняйтесь обращаться за помощью к специалистам, если чувствуете, что не можете справиться самостоятельно."},{"prompt":"Спасибо за советы, но все они достаточно очевидные и известны мне. Я пишу себе цели и задачи на день, причем достаточно реалистичные, но все упирается в то, что я достаточно часто отвлекаюсь или увлекаюсь какой-нибудь одной задачей, а на остальные потом уже не остаётся времени или же получается так, что я засиживаюсь допоздна, и поддерживать режим сна не получается. Что может здесь помочь с психологической точки зрения","response":"Если вы замечаете, что несмотря на планирование и знание основ управления временем все равно сталкиваетесь с проблемами в виде отвлечений и увлеченности одной задачей, то возможно следует подумать о подходах, которые помогут с психологической точки зрения улучшить концентрацию и самодисциплину. # 1. Переосмысление отношения к задачам - **\\"Почему\\" вместо \\"Что\\".** Сфокусируйтесь на причинах, почему вам нужно выполнить задачу, а не просто на ее выполнении. Это может помочь увеличить мотивацию. - **Позитивное мышление.** Подходите к выполнению задачи с позитивной стороны, представляя положительные стороны и результаты ее завершения. # 2. Медитация и ментальные тренировки - **Медитация.** Практика медитации может помочь улучшить концентрацию, научиться управлять своими мыслями и снизить уровень стресса. - **Визуализация успеха.** Представьте себе, как вы успешно справляетесь со всеми задачами. Это может помотивировать и улучшить ваше отношение к выполнению задач. # 3. Разбиение задач на подзадачи - **Маленькие шаги.** Если ощущаете, что увлекаетесь одной задачей, попробуйте разбить ее на меньшие шаги. Это поможет ощутить прогресс и контроль над временем. # 4. Понимание и принятие собственных особенностей - **Уникальность методов.** Признайте, что у каждого свой ритм и методы работы. Для некоторых работа по таймеру эффективна, для других может подходить подход \\"работа — короткий отдых — работа\\". # 5. Установление четких границ - Ограничьте возможности для отвлечений. Если вы работаете дома, сообщите домашним, что в определенное время вы не должны быть потревожены. # 6. Обращение к специалисту - **Консультация с психологом.** Если испробовали различные методики, но ощущаете, что проблема глубже и связана, возможно, с прокрастинацией, тревогой или другими факторами, консультация с психологом может оказаться очень полезной. Наконец, важно понимать, что улучшение управления временем — это процесс, который требует времени и усилий. Не ругайте себя за неудачи или отвлечения. Лучше анализируйте их причины и извлекайте уроки для будущего. Ваш подход к работе и жизни вцелом будет совершенствоваться постепенно, если вы будете прилагать усилия и оставаться открытыми к изменениям."},{"prompt":"create a list paramecia devil fruit ideas","response":"Certainly!

You said what characters did, you quoted their dialogue, and, if need be, you told what they thought: “This is easy, Joe thought, as he ambled down the quay.” The only tricky thing here is knowing what a quay is. But then, as Virginia Woolf points out, “On or about December 1910, human nature changed.” Certainly the novelist’s relationship to consciousness did. As a result of huge changes in the scientific and philosophical understanding of the mind—the by-products of work by Freud and Jung and William James and Henri Bergson (who won a Nobel Prize in literature)—the depiction of consciousness became much more fluid. And messy. As a movement, stream of consciousness had a short tenure, only three decades or so. Yet it helped to define the modern novel, change how later writers approached character, and bewilder generations of English classes. But we’ll be bewildered no more. Or maybe just a little. So what is this beast, stream of consciousness? Oh, that’s easy: it doesn’t exist. Lot of help, right? Nevertheless, it’s true: there is no single thing to which we can point and say, “Stream of consciousness.” There are a lot of works that seem to fit the notion, but they’re hardly all doing the same thing. It’s a lot like obscenity: no one can define it, but everyone thinks he knows it when he sees it. Okay, we have something that may not exist, that no one has satisfactorily defined, that existed only briefly, and that tends to confuse readers. Where do I go to sign up? And can it possibly matter? Oh, yes, it matters greatly. On one level it matters because of all those bigwigs of modernism who attempted new things. They came, they went. But something stayed behind, and that something matters. Prior to the start of all this —let’s take Woolf’s 1910, plus or minus a few—readers and writers could automatically expect a certain level of authority in the telling of a tale. There was a narrative center that existed outside the characters in the tale. That center is easiest to see in the omniscient narrators of the great Victorian novels, whether Bleak House or Vanity Fair or Middlemarch. There is clearly an intelligence that exists external to the story, one that shapes the story and says, in effect, “We exist outside this story, but through my agency, we can go not only into the story but into the thoughts of the characters at will. That is, at my will.” That outside center, however, also exists in the first-person narratives. Outside? Of course, outside. The Pip who narrates Great Expectations is clearly separate from the child Pip who stumbles into the clutches of Magwitch at the novel’s opening. Most of his life to date has taken place in the intervening years. But he’s also separate from the Pip who talks to Joe Gargery about being a gentleman late in the novel and who has his final, memorable meeting with Estella. The narrating Pip exists both outside and after those character Pips. How can we be sure? Verb tense. The past tense of the narrative—not simple present or some progressive form—argues for distance from the events and the self within the narrative. So? How does that make a difference? It means everything we know about the character, and especially everything we know from the character is mediated. There’s a conscious presence imposed between us and young Pip or Esther Summerson filtering their thoughts—selecting, arranging, rewording—so that we know them only in this shaped, rather distant form. For all their variety, the one thing common to stream-of-consciousness novels is their desire to do away with that mediation, to get not merely close to but inside the characters’ heads. Swell idea, but where’s the road map? As it turns out, the woods in 1900 were just full of cartographers. As I said before, there is no single technique known as “stream of consciousness.” Rather, we use the term, very loosely, to describe the effects produced by a number of techniques, and more generally to describe a certain type of fiction that seeks to reproduce consciousness in all its complexity and with a minimum of narrative mediation. And while they differ considerably from one another, they have this in common: the loss of a narrative center outside character. Instead, narration began to find a home within characters’ minds, and not always the minds of which they were aware. Because, as it turns out, “mind” gives way to “consciousness,” and consciousness is composed of multiple levels. Pretty much everybody seems to have had this idea of depth at the same time. The term first arises in William James’s work The Principles of Psychology (1890), where he prefers it to “train” or “chain” of consciousness. The fluidity and continuum of depths suggested by “stream” make it more nearly ideal as a descriptor of James’s notion of consciousness. Some of his brother Henry’s late works begin to explore consciousness as operating simultaneously on a variety of levels, although none of them could be properly described as stream-of￾consciousness novels. So far so good, right? But here’s the thing: it had already begun to exist in practice. Two years earlier, Édouard Dujardin did something remarkable in his short novel, Les lauriers sont coupé (the first English translation: We’ll to the Woods No More, the second, The Bays Are Sere—clearly imprecise renderings). He employed, for the first time I believe, a technique that is recognizable as interior monologue. It’s a lot like a regular monologue except that it is unspoken, inside the head, and largely unshaped. What Dujardin recognizes at once is that thoughts go where they will, leap in ways that defy logic, and take on a life of their own. A drop of wine. Empty, the seats opposite; between the seat and the mirror, leather upholstery. I must see what happens with a note— anyway. My card-case; my address card, that’s more suitable; my pocket-pencil; very well. What shall I put? A rendezvous for tomorrow. I must indicate several. If that solid solicitor knew what I was up to! I write: ‘Tomorrow, at two, in the reading room of the Magasin du Louvre…’The Magasin du Louvre, not very chic, but still the most convenient; and then, or somewhere else? The Louvre? go on with you! At two o’clock. Need to allow enough time; at least from two till three; that’s it; I change ‘at’to ‘ from’ and I’m going to add ‘until three’. Next ‘I…I will wait for you…’No, ‘I will wait’; that’s it; let’s see. Perhaps not surprisingly for an experimental work, Dujardin’s novel lapsed into neglect and was largely forgotten in 1902 when Joyce stumbled across a copy in a bookseller’s shop in Tours, France. The impact is undeniable, for despite a twenty-year gap, Joyce copies Dujardin’s style exactly for many of Leopold Bloom’s monologues in Ulysses. Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, riveted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.","response":"غرق شدن در آگاهی جاری روزی روزگاری، روایت ساده بود. شما اعمال شخصیت‌ها را می‌گفتید، دیالوگ‌های آنها را نقل می‌کردید و، در صورت نیاز، افکار آنها را بازگو می‌کردید: \\"این آسان است،\\" جو فکر کرد، در حالی که در اسکله قدم می‌زد.\\" تنها چیز پیچیده اینجا دانستن معنی اسکله است. اما سپس، همانطور که ویرجینیا وولف اشاره می‌کند، \\"حدودا در دسامبر 1910، طبیعت انسان تغییر کرد.\\" قطعاً رابطه رمان‌نویس با آگاهی تغییر کرد. به عنوان نتیجه تغییرات عظیم در درک علمی و فلسفی از ذهن -

بیایید 1910 وولف را بگیریم، به علاوه یا منهای چند - خوانندگان و نویسندگان می‌توانستند به طور خودکار انتظار سطحی از اقتدار در روایت یک داستان را داشته باشند. یک مرکز روایی وجود داشت که خارج از شخصیت‌ها در داستان وجود داشت. این مرکز در روایت‌های دانای کل نوول‌های بزرگ ویکتوریایی، چه خانه افسرده یا نمایش غرور یا میدلمارچ، به راحتی دیده می‌شود. قطعا یک هوشی وجود دارد که خارج از داستان وجود دارد، یکی که داستان را شکل می‌دهد و می‌گوید، در واقع، \\"ما خارج از این داستان وجود داریم، اما از طریق نمایندگی من، ما می‌توانیم نه تنها وارد داستان شویم بلکه به دلخواه به افکار شخصیت‌ها وارد شویم. یعنی، به خواست من.\\" اما این مرکز خارجی، همچنین در روایت‌های شخص اول وجود دارد. خارج؟ البته، خارج. پیپی که انتظارات بزرگ را روایت می‌کند، قطعا از پیپ کودکی که در ابتدای رمان به دام مگویچ افتاد، جدا است. بیشتر زندگی‌اش تا به امروز در سال‌های میانی اتفاق افتاده است. اما او همچنین از پیپی که در اواخر رمان با جو گارگری درباره بودن یک آقا صحبت می‌کند و که دیدار نهایی، به یادماندنی خود را با استلا دارد، جدا است. پیپ روایت‌کننده هم خارج و هم پس از آن پیپهای شخصیت وجود دارد. چگونه مطمئن باشیم؟ زمان فعل. زمان گذشته روایت - نه حال ساده یا برخی از اشکال پیشرو - برای فاصله از رویدادها و خود درون روایت دلیل می‌آورد. پس؟ این چگونه تفاوتی ایجاد می‌کند؟ همه چیزی که درباره شخصیت می‌دانیم، و به خصوص همه چیزی که از شخصیت می‌دانیم، میانجی‌گری شده است. یک حضور آگاهانه بین ما و پیپ جوان یا استر سامرسون وجود دارد که افکار آن‌ها را فیلتر می‌کند - انتخاب می‌کند، مرتب می‌کند، بازنویسی می‌کند - به طوری که فقط آنها را در این شکل شکل‌داده‌شده، تا حدی دور می‌شناسیم. با وجود تنوع آنها، یک چیز مشترک به رمان‌های آگاهی جاری این است که آنها می‌خواهند آن میانجی‌گری را حذف کنند، تا نه تنها به نزدیکی بلکه به داخل سر شخصیت‌ها بروند. ایده عالی، اما نقشه راه کجاست؟ همانطور که از بیرون معلوم است، جنگل‌ها در سال 1900 پر از نقشه‌کش‌ها بود. همانطور که قبلاً گفتم، هیچ تکنیک واحدی به عنوان \\"آگاهی جاری\\" وجود ندارد. بلکه، ما اصطلاح را، به طور خیلی آزاد، برای توصیف اثرات تولید شده توسط چندین تکنیک استفاده می‌کنیم و به طور کلی برای توصیف نوعی داستان که سعی دارد آگاهی را در همه پیچیدگی‌هایش و با حداقل میانجی‌گری روایی بازتولید کند. و در حالی که آنها از یکدیگر به طور قابل توجهی متفاوت هستند، این مورد را مشترک دارند: از دست دادن یک مرکز روایی خارج از شخصیت. به جای آن، روایت شروع به یافتن خانه در درون ذهن شخصیت‌ها کرد، و نه همیشه ذهنی که آنها از آن آگاه بودند. زیرا، همانطور که از قرار معلوم، \\"ذهن\\" به \\"آگاهی\\" تبدیل می‌شود، و آگاهی از چندین سطح تشکیل شده است. تقریباً همه به نظر می‌رسد همزمان این ایده عمق را داشتند. اصطلاح اولین بار در کار ویلیام جیمز، اصول روان‌شناسی (1890)، مطرح می‌شود، جایی که او به آن ترجیح می‌دهد به جای \\"قطار\\" یا \\"زنجیر\\" آگاهی. روانی و پیوستگی عمق‌های پیشنهاد شده توسط \\"جریان\\" آن را به عنوان یک ویژگی‌دهنده بیشتر نزدیک به مفهوم جیمز از آگاهی ایده‌آل می‌سازد. برخی از آثار دیرینه برادرش هنری شروع به کاوش در آگاهی به عنوان عملی که همزمان در تنوعی از سطوح عمل می‌کند می‌کنند، اگرچه هیچ‌کدام از آنها را نمی‌توان به درستی به عنوان رمان‌های آگاهی جاری توصیف کرد. تا به اینجا خوب است، درست است؟ اما اینجا چیزی است: این قبلاً شروع به وجود آمده بود. دو سال زودتر، ادوار دوژاردن کار قابل توجهی انجام داد، در رمان کوتاه خود، لوریه‌ها بریده شده‌اند (اولین ترجمه انگلیسی: دیگر به جنگل نخواهیم رفت، دومین، خلیج‌ها خشک شده‌اند - قطعاً بازنمایی‌های نادقیق). او، برای اولین بار به نظر می‌رسد، از یک تکنیک قابل شناسایی به عنوان مونولوگ درونی استفاده کرد. خیلی شبیه یک مونولوگ معمولی به جز اینکه گفته نشده، درون سر است، و عمدتاً بدون شکل است. آنچه دوژاردن بلافاصله متوجه می‌شود این است که افکار به جایی می‌روند که خواهند، به روش‌هایی پرش می‌کنند که منطق را نقض می‌کنند، و زندگی خودشان را به دست می‌گیرند. یک قطره شراب. خالی، صندلی‌های روبرو؛ بین صندلی و آینه، روکش چرمی. باید ببینم با یک یادداشت چه می‌شود -

Однако при этом страдает режим сна и сам сон соответственно. Как мне решить эту проблему. Помоги пожалуйста","response":"Ваша проблема довольно распространенная и связана с понятием \\"местьенное маргинализованное время\\" или \\"revenge bedtime procrastination\\", которое описывает ситуацию, когда люди откладывают сон, чтобы заниматься приятными или интересными для себя вещами, потому что днем не ощущают возможности заниматься собой. Вот несколько советов, как справиться с этой проблемой: 1. **Планирование времени**. Попробуйте планировать свой день так, чтобы у вас было достаточно времени для занятий, которые вам нравятся и которые помогут вам расслабиться и зарядиться энергией. Составьте расписание, включающее ваши обязанности и время на отдых. 2. **Установка четкого режима сна**. Постарайтесь ложиться и вставать в одно и то же время каждый день, включая выходные. Это поможет настроить ваше тело на регулярный график сна. 3. **Предсоновые ритуалы**. Разработайте для себя спокойные предсоновые ритуалы, которые помогут вам расслабиться перед сном. Это может быть чтение книги, прослушивание спокойной музыки, медитация или легкие упражнения растяжки. 4. **Ограничение использования электронных устройств**. Постарайтесь избегать использования телефонов, компьютеров и других экранов за час до сна. Синий свет от экранов может подавлять выработку мелатонина и ухудшать качество вашего сна. 5. **Оценка вашего дня**. Попытайтесь найти причины, по которым вы чувствуете, что ваш день был недостаточно насыщенным или удовлетворительным. Могут ли быть какие-то изменения в вашем распорядке дня, которые помогли бы вам чувствовать себя более удовлетворенным и эффективным? 6. **Эксперименты с хобби или занятиями**. Иногда помогает расширение кругозора или поиск новых хобби, которые могли бы приносить радость и чувство удовлетворения без необходимости жертвовать сном. 7. **Консультация со специалистом**. Если соблюдение вышеуказанных советов не помогает и проблема сохраняется, возможно стоит обратиться к специалисту (психологу или сомнологу) для поиска индивидуального решения. Помните, что достаточное количество сна имеет критическое значение для здоровья, благополучия и продуктивности. Улучшение качества вашего сна может положительно повлиять на многие аспекты вашей жизни."},{"prompt":"","response":"Hello! It looks like you didn't ask a question. How can I assist you?

そしてマルクスに残る不備を是正し、労働力商品の特殊性の明確化から、この問題の解決に道を拓いたのが、宇野弘蔵の原理論研究であた。宇野は、労働力商品化の矛盾の把握を根本に、『資本論』を原理論として純化·再編したが、そこではじめて労働力の価値と使用価值も資本の蓄積過程で(1)決定されることが明らかにされたのである。いわば純経済的に規定されうることが明確にされたのであるが、それは当然のことながら宇野理論における科学とイデォロギーとの峻別に対応していた。 小論は、宇野理論の継承上で、労働日の決定メカニズムの論証を図ったが、そこからは当然労働日規定からの階級闘争および法·国家的な契機の排除が結論されることになろう。 この結論は、階級闘争の有する意義を貶めるものではない。むしろ逆である。では、労働日が純経くびき済的に規定されるということは、一体何を意味するのか。それは、労働者階級が資本の軛から解放され、労働日や「賃金」を自ら決定するためには、労働力商品化の廃棄が絶対的条件となることを指示していよう。階級対立そのものの止揚をまつて、はじめて自由時間と労働時間との対立の揚棄が実現され、「真実の経済··.は、労働時間の節約にある」というテーゼが直接活きてくる。いわばそこでのみ人間は「時の主人」すなわち歴史の主体になりえるのである。そこでは、経済活動が人間本来の目的追求のための手段として位置づけられ、「本来的な費用」にすぎない人間の労働日の節約·短縮が、意識的に企てられることになろう。資本主義における労働の生産力の発展が、決して労働日の短縮に結びつかないことと対比すれば、かかる事態の有する決定的な意義は明白である。自由時間の拡大が人間解放の基礎条件をなす限りで、労働日の短縮が「人間にとってもっとも重要な課題」となるが、その実現のためには資本主義の廃棄すなわち労働日の運動法則からの解放が達成されなければならない。すべての経済は結局は「時間の経済」に帰着するが、法則を廃棄した社会ではじめて「時間の経済」は人間の自主的＝意識的なコントロールのもとに服することになる。 これにたいし、資本主義体制の内部での、労働日をめぐる労働者の闘争は、賃金などをめぐる経済闘争と同じく、労働者の生活水準を向上させるための闘争として位置づけられよう。いわば労働日の短縮→生活時間の増大は、労働者が、そこでプチ·プルジョア的意識や消費的なレジャー文化に毒されないかぎり、彼の階級的および人間的成長を促すものとして、その意味を明らかにされるのである。いわばそれは、労働者に、社会を自主的に運営していく主体としての能力を養成するかぎりで、将来の人間解放のための物質的かつ時間的な基礎をなすものといえよう。 労働日規定の完成は、体制変革とその主体を基本的に明らかにすると同時に、その窮極目標との関連で労働条件をめぐる階級闘争の有する位相を明確にし、社会主義運動の展開に科学的な根拠を提供することになる。これに反し、階級闘争を力說するマハト·テオリーは、逆說的に、労働者の生活改善のための経済闘争をそれ自身自己目的化し、社会主義を改良主義に解消しかねないのである。”翻译为中文","response":"“但是，劳动力商品的价值规定和使用价值规定在《资本论》中并未得到充分阐明。可以看到经济外部的规定混入和阶级斗争逻辑的残留。可以说，即使是经过马克思大约三十年的努力，科学与意识形态的关系问题也未能得到正确的解决。 而修正了马克思遗留下来的不足、从劳动力商品的特殊性明确化着手、为这个问题的解决开辟了道路的，是宇野弘藏的原理论研究。宇野以劳动力商品化的矛盾理解为基础，将《资本论》纯化·重编为原理论，在那里首次明确了劳动力的价值和使用价值是在资本积累过程中确定的。也就是说，明确了可以纯粹经济地规定的事项，这自然而然地对应于宇野理论中科学与意识形态的严格区分。 本论文在继承宇野理论的基础上，试图论证劳动日的决定机制，由此自然会得出从劳动日规定中排除阶级斗争以及法律·国家的契机的结论。 这个结论并非减损了阶级斗争的意义。相反，那么，劳动日被纯经济地规定，究竟意味着什么呢？这意味着，要想劳动者阶级从资本的枷锁中解放出来，由自己决定劳动日和“工资”，必须绝对地废弃劳动力商品化。只有等到阶级对立本身的超越，才能实现自由时间与劳动时间对立的消除，直接体现“真正的经济……在于节省劳动时间”的论断。这样人类才能成为“时间的主人”，即历史的主体。在这里，经济活动被定位为追求人类本身目的的手段，人类劳动日的节约·缩短将被有意识地策划。与资本主义下劳动生产力的发展决不与劳动日缩短相连的情况对比下，这种情况具有的决定性意义是显而易见的。只要自由时间的扩展构成了人类解放的基础条件，劳动日的缩短成为“对人类来说最重要的任务”，但为了实现它，必须完成资本主义的废除，即从劳动日的运动法则中解放出来。所有的经济最终都归结为“时间的经济”，在废除了法则的社会中，“时间的经济”才首次服从于人类自主的=有意识的控制。 相对于在资本主义体系内部，围绕劳动日的工人斗争，就像是围绕工资等的经济斗争一样，定位为提高工人生活水平的斗争。可以说，劳动日缩短→生活时间增大，在工人尚未被小资产阶级意识或消费性休闲文化所毒害的情况下，将其阶级和人的成长促进作为其意义明确化。这可以说是，在一定程度上为工人培养成为自主管理社会的主体的能力，为未来人类解放奠定物质和时间的基础。 劳动日规定的完成，同时在体制转变及其主体方面做出基本澄清，且在与其最终目标的关联中明确了围绕劳动条件的阶级斗争所具有的相位，为社会主义运动的展开提供科学依据。相反，大力讲述阶级斗争的马哈特理论，反讽地，可能将工人的生活改善的经济斗争自行目的化，从而将社会主义解消为改良主义。”"},{"prompt":"请将“（1）「いわゆる窮乏化の法則について」、「労働力の価値と価格-労働力商品の特殊性について」、「恐慌論の課題」など、一連の宇野の論文を参照。 （2）初期のマルクスとェンゲルスは、社会主義を＜疎外された労働＞からの解放としてとらえたため、社会主義にあっては労働は人間的本質をなすものとして、疎外されない、協同の類的活動になるとする見方をとつていた。生産的労働は苦痛から喜びにかわり、自己の人間的成長と社会的存在を確認するための本来的な活動になるとされたのである。これは、フーリェの労働＝遊戯論とヘーゲルの労働＝人間本質論を統一した哲学的な社会主義観といえよう。 だが、『経済学批判要綱』での労働力商品の概念化を契機、経済原則（＝「労働一般」）と経済法則（＝「資本の生産過程」）が区別され、資本主義的生産の特殊歴史的性格が科学的に認識されてくると、先の社会主義観も修正されることになる。経済活動は人間本来の目的を追求するための手段とされ、生産的労働は短縮·節約されるべき「費用」と位置づけられることになるのである。もっとも、労働を広義に解釈し、対象化活動一般（=人間の本質的諸力の外化→主体と疎外態との緊張→自己への奪回）として把握すれば、後期マルクスは悪しき科学主義＝経済主義として批判されるかもしれない。しかし、それは人間活動一般にしめる経済活動の意義を理解しない一種の浪漫派社会主義といわなければならない。現代の「社会主義」諸国の後退現象（＝市場経済の肯定、経済効率の重視と生産力主義など）が逆說的に示しているように、社会主義の成立には、生産力の継承と労働条件の自主的決定かつ社会的労働の合理的配分が不可欠なのである。社会主義では、冷徹な眼をもって、労働日の縮減自由時間の増大が図られなければならない。”翻译为中文","response":"（1）请参考宇野的一系列论文，如“所谓贫困化法则”、“劳动力的价值与价格——劳动力商品的特殊性”、“恐慌论的任务”等。 （2）早期的马克思和恩格斯将社会主义视作从“异化劳动”中解放出来，认为在社会主义中，劳动将成为人的本质的一部分，不再是异化的，而是合作的、类似的活动。生产性劳动会由痛苦变为乐趣，成为确认自己的人类成长和社会存在的原本活动。这可以说是将傅立叶的劳动=游戏论和黑格尔的劳动=人类本质论统一起来的哲学社会主义观。 但是，随着在《经济学批评大纲》中对劳动力商品概念的确立，经济原则（=“劳动一般”）与经济法则（=“资本的生产过程”）被区分开来，资本主义生产的特殊历史性质开始被科学地认识，之前的社会主义观念也随之得到修正。经济活动被视为追求人的本来目的的手段，生产性劳动被认为是应当被缩短、节约的“费用”。当然，如果将劳动广义地理解，作为对象化活动一般（=人的本质力量的外化→主体与异化状态的紧张→自我回收），后期马克思也许会被批评为恶劣的科学主义=经济主义。但这必须被视为一种不理解经济活动在人类活动中所占意义的浪漫主义社会主义。 正如当代“社会主义”国家的退步现象（=市场经济的肯定、经济效率的重视和生产力主义等）逆向地表明的那样，社会主义的建立，必须继承生产力和自主决定劳动条件以及社会劳动的合理分配是不可或缺的。在社会主义中，必须冷静地计划劳动日的减少和自由时间的增加。"},{"prompt":"Note: This is in an alternate universe, This shop, despite being

shopping with us for so many years, You can find all about KikoRiki and its related online MMO RolyPolyLand at riki.com Goodbye forever… This sign was posted to the doors of Riki, a children’s shop in Glasgow on Wednesday The image ends with a poignant “Goodbye forever…” above a image of a crying Krash the Rabbit The store closed on Wedensday after 12 years trading at Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow The shop sold merchandise related to the animated series KikoRiki, The cartoon is a Russian cartoon about circular colorful animals and their fun adventures, The Riki shop opened in 1995 was originally Golden Adventures and was a general toy shop akin to Toys R Us but in 2003 became Riki and became focused on the then new surge in KikoRiki popularity in Scotland, However in June 2007, the store closed for the last time, Riki Group’s reasoning was the “realities of retail” was unavoidable, The shop was also closed so Riki could focus on business in it’s native Russia and develop more exciting new animated series or movies Hidden Glasgow - Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion.

Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey. Write the ad, with the final words being “goodbye forever…” with “The fun doesn’t have to end here, Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik”, shown below The logos and web adresses “stv.tv” “itv.com/citv” and “toonattik.tv” are shown below, Incidentally RolyPolyLand is not mentioned at all [Scene opens with a slow, gentle pan across the empty interior of the once vibrant Riki store on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here. Continue the adventures and laughter with your favorite characters.” [The screen now displays the current logos of STV and CITV, alongside the Toonattik logo, with web addresses neatly listed below each logo:] - STV: stv.tv - CITV: itv.com/citv - Toonattik: toonattik.tv Narrator: “Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik, and keep the spirit of Riki alive.” [The music gently fades as the screen transitions to black, ending with a final soft echo of the store’s theme melody.] Narrator (whisper): “Thank you, and take care, wherever you are.” [End of Ad.] Write a tweet where a user notices that on the Cinema rip posted by “Hall of Advertising” in 2016 you can clearly see the logos, whereas on the original video uploaded in 2007, the logos look like a blue blob, a dark blue and cream blob and a blue yellow, white and pink blob respectively User: @NostalgiaJunkie85 “Just watched the cinema rip of the Riki store goodbye ad on 'Hall of Advertising’s 2016 post and wow, what a difference! 🎥👀 You can actually see the STV, CITV, and Toonattik logos CLEARLY, unlike in the original 2007 upload where they were just mysterious blobs of color. Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a blog post from the Royal Concert Hall in June 2007 titled \\"The Most Sad Task of Our Lives\\" and explain the situation","response":"As I sit here, surrounded by the grandeur and beauty of the Royal Concert Hall, I find myself faced with what feels like the most somber task of our lives. The closure of the beloved Riki store, a place that brought so much joy and laughter to countless children and families, has left a void in our hearts and in the very fabric of our community. The memories of the vibrant KikoRiki characters adorning the shelves, the sound of children's laughter echoing through the aisles, and the sense of wonder and excitement that filled the air can still be felt, even as the store now stands empty and silent. The final moments of Riki, captured in the closing ad with Krash shedding a tear and the haunting lullaby playing in the background, are etched in our minds as a poignant farewell to a cherished part of Glasgow's history. The decision to close the store was not an easy one, but the realities of retail and the changing landscape of shopping in our city made it unavoidable. The staff, who poured their hearts and souls into creating a magical experience for every visitor, now face the uncertain future that comes with the closure of a beloved establishment. And yet, even in this moment of sadness and loss, there is a glimmer of hope. The memories of Riki, the stories shared, and the experiences had within those walls will forever be a part of our collective history. The spirit of Riki lives on in the hearts of all who were touched by its magic, and the legacy of the store will continue to inspire and bring joy to generations to come. As we bid farewell to Riki, let us hold onto the memories, the laughter, and the sense of wonder that it brought into our lives. May we carry the spirit of Riki with us always, remembering the joy it brought and the community it fostered. Goodbye, Riki, you will be deeply missed, but your legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew and loved you."},{"prompt":"Write a forum convo where Clyde 1 ceases FM transmission in 2030 to go DAB and online only, Riki fans are surprised at the last thing the FM frequency played before going into a retune announcement loop.","response":"Thread Title: End of an Era: Clyde 1 Ceases FM Transmission --- User1: RadioFanatic Did anyone catch the news that Clyde 1 has officially ceased FM transmission and will now be available only on DAB and online?

The Louvre? go on with you! At two o’clock. Need to allow enough time; at least from two till three; that’s it; I change ‘at’to ‘ from’ and I’m going to add ‘until three’. Next ‘I…I will wait for you…’No, ‘I will wait’; that’s it; let’s see. Perhaps not surprisingly for an experimental work, Dujardin’s novel lapsed into neglect and was largely forgotten in 1902 when Joyce stumbled across a copy in a bookseller’s shop in Tours, France. The impact is undeniable, for despite a twenty-year gap, Joyce copies Dujardin’s style exactly for many of Leopold Bloom’s monologues in Ulysses. Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d like my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, riveted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this. Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just got an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you know? In the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can’t he hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife. Part of being a genius is knowing when you’ve found a winner. What the interior monologue does for Joyce is allow him—and us—to follow the meanderings of his characters, especially Leopold Bloom, who is a world-class meanderer. Of his wife Molly, more anon. The intellectual sanction for this new fiction is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Henri Bergson. In works such as Matter and Memory, Laughter, and Time and Free Will, Bergson lays out a theory of mind, memory, and the subjective experience of time that gives free reign to the novelistic explorers of consciousness. At the center of experience in the “new” fiction is memory. Bergson distinguishes between mémoire volontaire, which is a product of reason and will, the portion of memory we can control, and mémoire involontaire, which is the part writers can make use of. This latter is capricious, flowing uncertainly, never quite graspable. We see when we look at writing by Joyce or Woolf, for instance, just how much of memory is involuntary, how little control we have over the images that float to the surface, often to haunt or mock us. Another key notion is la durée, or durational time. As opposed to clock time or metronomic time, humans experience time subjectively, so that moments are almost infinitely elastic, as in the instant before the car crash when one “sees” one’s life flash before one’s eyes. The notion of durational time, curiously enough, is picked up by the imagist poets for their tiny creations and by novelists with ambitions as large as the author of Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. In the practice of fiction, durational time allows for almost limitless exploration of a single moment, as the mind can be functioning on a host of levels and covering a wide array of subjects all at once as time seems, at least sometimes, to stand still. The change in the narrative presence is most notable in the stream-of￾consciousness novel. This is not to suggest, however, that narrators disappear entirely; rather, the narrator ceases to act as mediator or filter for the characters’ thoughts and acts more as presenter or conduit for direct transcription, with little or no authorial commentary. Where Dickens would tell us what someone was thinking and what it might mean or portend, Faulkner or Joyce give us not only the thoughts (the word suggesting an awareness and even a control by the character), but the whole jumble of thought, instinct, pre-thought, reflex, and response to stimulus to which the character is subject. In stream-ofconsciousness fiction a character’s thoughts are presented directly, without mediation by an intrusive narrator; he speaks, as it were, to himself. Hence the use of contractions and of the second person. The effect of the latter is to give what is said a more general significance, the speaker assuming that his reactions and thoughts do not hold for him alone but for any human being.","response":"اما همچنان راحت‌ترین راه است؛ پس، در کجا؟ لوور؟ ادامه بده! ساعت دو. باید وقت کافی در نظر گرفت؛ حداقل از دو تا سه؛ همینه؛ من \\"در\\" را به \\"از\\" تغییر می‌دهم و \\"تا سه\\" را اضافه می‌کنم. بعدی \\"من...من منتظر تو خواهم بود...\\" نه، \\"من منتظر خواهم بود\\"؛ همینه؛ ببینیم. شاید نه چندان عجیب برای یک اثر تجربی، رمان دوژاردن به فراموشی سپرده شد و تقریباً در سال ۱۹۰۲، زمانی که جویس نسخه‌ای را در یک کتابفروشی در شهر تور فرانسه پیدا کرد، به کلی فراموش شده بود. تأثیر انکارناپذیر است، زیرا با وجود فاصله‌ای بیست ساله، جویس سبک دوژاردن را دقیقاً برای بسیاری از منولوگ‌های لئوپولد بلوم در اولیس کپی می‌کند. آن حقه مرا به خواب نینداخت. لمس سریع. نشان نرم. کارم را دوست دارم. کیف دستی که علاقه خاصی به آن دارم. چرمی. گوشه‌های کلاه دار، لبه‌های میخکوب، قفل دو کاره. باب کاولی سال گذشته برای کنسرت قایقرانی ویکلو به او قرض داد و از آن روز تا به حال خبری از آن نشده است. آقای بلوم به سمت خیابان برونزویک قدم زنان، لبخند زد. همسرم تازه یکی گرفته. سوپرانوی ریزبند با لکه‌های کک و مک. بینی مثل تراشه پنیر. تا حدی خوبه: برای یک ترانه کوچک. شیرجه‌ای در آن نیست. تو و من، می‌دانی؟ در یک قایق هستیم. خوش‌زبانی. بهت سوزنی خواهد زد. نمی‌تواند تفاوت را بشنود؟ فکر می‌کند که او کمی به آن سمت متمایل است. به نظر من از راست به چپه. فکر می‌کردم بلفاست او را جلب کند. امیدوارم آبله بالای شهر بدتر نشود. فرض کن همسرت دیگر خودش را واکسینه نکند. همسر تو و همسر من. بخشی از بودن یک نابغه دانستن زمانی است که برنده‌ای پیدا می‌کنی. آنچه مونولوگ درونی برای جویس انجام می‌دهد این است که او و ما را قادر می‌سازد تا دنباله‌ی فکری شخصیت‌هایش، بخصوص لئوپولد بلوم که در همین کار دنیایی است، دنبال کنیم. درباره همسرش مولی، بعداً بیشتر خواهیم گفت. تأیید فکری برای این داستان جدید به طور عمده از آثار فیلسوف فرانسوی هانری برگسون ناشی می‌شود. در آثاری مانند ماده و حافظه، خنده، و زمان و اراده آزاد، برگسون یک نظریه درباره ذهن، حافظه و تجربه ذهنی زمان را ارائه می‌دهد که راه را بر کاوشگران رمانی از آگاهی باز می‌کند. در مرکز تجربه در داستان \\"جدید\\" حافظه قرار دارد. برگسون بین حافظه داوطلبانه، که محصول عقل و اراده است، بخشی از حافظه که می‌توانیم کنترل کنیم، و حافظه ناخواسته، که بخشی است که نویسندگان می‌توانند از آن استفاده کنند، تمایز قائل می‌شود. این دومی سرکش است، به‌طور نامطمئنی جاری می‌شود، هرگز کاملاً قابل درک نیست. وقتی به نوشته‌های جویس یا وولف نگاه می‌کنیم، می‌بینیم که چقدر از حافظه ناخواسته است، چقدر کنترل کمی بر تصاویری داریم که به سطح می‌آیند، غالباً برای تسخیر یا مسخره کردن ما. یک مفهوم کلیدی دیگر la durée، یا زمان مداوم است. در مقابل زمان ساعت یا زمان مترونومی، انسان‌ها زمان را به‌صورت ذهنی تجربه می‌کنند، به‌طوری که لحظات تقریباً بی‌نهایت انعطاف‌پذیر هستند، همان‌طور که در لحظه قبل از تصادف اتومبیل، کسی \\"زندگی‌اش را پیش چشمش می‌بیند\\". مفهوم زمان مداوم، به طور عجیبی، توسط شاعران تصویری برای آفرینش‌های کوچکشان و توسط رمان‌نویسانی با آرزوهایی به بزرگی نویسنده اولیس و بیداری فینگنز، برداشته شده است. در عمل داستان‌نویسی، زمان مداوم امکان کاوش تقریباً نامحدود یک لحظه را فراهم می‌کند، زیرا ذهن می‌تواند در یک میزبان از سطوح عمل کند و موضوعات متنوعی را همزمان پوشش دهد در حالی که زمان، حداقل گاهی اوقات، به نظر می‌رسد که ایستاده است. تغییر در حضور روایت در رمان جریان‌سازی آگاهی بسیار قابل توجه است. این به این معنا نیست که راویان کاملاً ناپدید می‌شوند؛ بلکه راوی دیگر به عنوان میانجی یا فیلتر برای افکار شخصیت‌ها عمل نمی‌کند و بیشتر به عنوان ارائه‌دهنده یا کانال برای نقل مکتوب مستقیم، با کمترین یا بدون تفسیر نویسنده عمل می‌کند. جایی که دیکنز به ما می‌گفت که کسی چه فکری می‌کرد و این ممکن است چه معنایی یا پیش‌بینی داشته باشد، فاکنر یا جویس نه تنها افکار (کلمه‌ای که نشان‌دهنده آگاهی و حتی کنترل توسط شخصیت است)، بلکه تمام هرج و مرج فکر، غریزه، پیش‌فکر، رفلکس و پاسخ به محرکاتی که شخصیت تحت آن قرار دارد را به ما می‌دهند. در داستان‌نویسی جریان آگاهی، افکار یک شخصیت مستقیماً بدون میانجی‌گری یک راوی مزاحم ارائه می‌شوند؛ او به نوعی با خودش صحبت می‌کند. از این رو، استفاده از کوتاه‌نویسی‌ها و خطاب به شخص دوم. تأثیر این آخری این است که چیزی که گفته می‌شود اهمیت عمومی بیشتری پیدا می‌کند، گوینده فرض می‌کند که واکنش‌ها و افکارش تنها برای او نیست، بلکه برای هر انسانی صادق است."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom.

Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion. We encourage you to share your memories and stories of Riki in the comments below. Let’s remember the joy together. Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey.

The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here.

It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a blog post on June 23 2007 about that they got there just before closing time, and heard the final moments, and then, the dreaded sign was put up","response":"Title: A Bittersweet Goodbye: Reflecting on the Closure of the Riki Store Date: June 23, 2007 As I arrived at the Riki store just before closing time today, I could sense a palpable sadness lingering in the air.

However, there are common standard sizes for domestic doorways in many regions. # United States: For interior doors, a common width is 30 inches (76.2 cm), but it can range from 24 inches (61 cm) for closet doors or narrow bathrooms up to 36 inches (91.44 cm) for doors that need to be accessible to those with disabilities. The standard height is often 80 inches (203.2 cm). For exterior doors, the standard width is typically 36 inches (91.44 cm) with a height of 80 inches (203.2 cm) as well. # United Kingdom and Europe: In the UK, common door sizes are slightly different and often measured in millimeters. Standard internal door sizes are often 1981mm in height and 762mm in width (approximately 78 inches by 30 inches). However, other common widths include 686mm (27 inches) and 838mm (33 inches). External doors in the UK and much of Europe are typically 1981mm x 838mm. # Accessibility Considerations: It’s worth noting that accessibility guidelines, such as those outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S., recommend doorways have a minimum clear width of 32 inches (81.28 cm) when the door is open 90 degrees, to allow for the passage of wheelchairs and other mobility aids.

Goodbye Riki Joeye posted on 23 June 2007 It’s the end of an era, Even bigger than the end of Evangelion, or even Christopher Eccleston leaving Doctor Who, The famous Riki store has gone, After about 12 years of selling toys and 4 years of its golden age of KikoRiki merchandise the store has unfortunately vanished, in its place is a rather upsetting image of Krash crying, It pains my heart to see the poor guy like this, Apparently “the realities of retail in the shopping landscape have made this change unavoidable” Whats most striking is “Goodbye forever…” written in a melancholic font, and the most striking part is that it’s showing Krash crying. My kids will miss the shop dearly. There is another sign giving the channel numbers for CITV, the channel that broadcasts the KikoRiki cartoon, Although there is an error, Telewest doesn’t exist anymore, it’s Virgin Media now. Anyways I was there on the last day, It all felt a bit more downbeat than usual, During the final day, the characters were giving reassuring smiles, reassuring us that we will still see them around Glasgow, and on CITV, The final half hour of the store had a looping pre-recorded announcement playing over the tannoy, sincerely thanking us for shopping over the years, “We would like to thank you who started shopping with us when we started as Golden Adventures, And especially when we were Riki” They also advertise CITV and RolyPolyLand “Catch us on the CITV channel everyday, and play our new online MMO RolyPolyLand” The message was very heartfelt, When I left at closing time they were already putting up posters, and the loop was replaced with a final announcement saying “Goodbye now, Take care, wherever you are” Then was there a sombre piece of music playing, before it fell silent as the lights were turned off, Johnstone posted on 23 June 2007 It’s a very sad state of affairs that Riki has ceased to exist. A good shop, Now we will have to trek to Toys R Us, And that’s literally at the Fort Shopping Centre near the Barrowland Ballroom. Harry replied on 23 June 2007 They should have kept it open, I am a fan of that show, Hopefully they find something good to take over the space, It will most likely be another Greggs, because it’s not like we’ve had enough of THOSE, right? Chingling replied on 24 June 2007 I went past Sauchiehall Street today, I noticed M&S has a sign saying “Our dearest condolences to staff of Riki”, I also saw the Riki closure notice, How sad it all is, Here is an image “ByeRiki.png” Someone cheer poor Krash up, he’s had a rough day, I want to hug the little furball, Incidentally Toys R Us in St Enoch centre are now selling toys of the show, so maybe Riki worked something out with Toys R Us, I also contacted Riki and was told the Goodbye forever note was written by David Lewis, who founded the Golden Adventures store, The Krash crying image was developed by Proud Creative (who just rebranded S4C in Wales), I remember that David handed his role as manager over to Anatoliy Prokhorov (who created the cartoon) in late 2003 after the store was rebranded. Anyways, this is the grief of losing Odeon at Renfied Street back in January last year all over again. Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin’s Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we’ve all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 “The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago” 😢 It’s sad to see it go, But let’s remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says “You’re safe, We almost lost you” Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article “Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn’t have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki YouTube - The final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store (24 June 2007) This video shows the very final moments of Glasgow’s Riki store, which was officially closed on Saturday, June 24rd. This is the last clip of the store, before it became little more than a sign explaining the closure, which still stands to this day, The store closed with a farewell announcement playing on loop for half an hour before a final farewell message played, which then became a very sad sounding lullaby, which was recorded at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. As this happened, the lights gradually dimmed before they went dark for the very last time. The final sign was put up on Saturday evening saying “Goodbye forever…” and depicting Krash’s sad-looking face, crying (designed by London-based Proud Creative) The store has not managed to secure a new tenant and has recently ran the risk of being knocked down to make way for a generic office, I can remember Clyde 1 the next day had their morning presenter closing their morning show with the Riki goodbye lullaby, He did this again on the 10th anniversary of his show and on the 10th anniversary of the store’s closure. Write a forum convo in June 2007 where on STV there was an ad of the empty store, Title: End of an Era: The Riki Goodbye Ad on STV User1: ClassicEraFan Hey everyone, did any of you catch that incredibly touching advert on STV last night? It was a short piece showcasing the now-emptied Riki store on Sauchiehall Street. The clip was serene yet so poignant, featuring a slow pan across the vacated shop floor, now devoid of the laughter and energy that once filled it. The visuals were accompanied by the same melancholy lullaby that played in the store’s final minutes, creating a powerful echo of farewell. User2: GlasgowNostalgia Yes, I saw it and it hit me harder than I expected. To think that just a few weeks ago, that place was bustling with families and kids, and now all that’s left are memories. The advert captured the essence of what Riki meant to so many of us in Glasgow. I never thought an ad could move me to tears, but here we are. User3: RikiRemembered It’s surreal to witness the transition from a vibrant childhood haven to what looked more like a relic of the past in that advert. Did anyone else notice how they used the image of Krash crying right at the end? It was as if the heart and soul of Riki were acknowledging the end of this significant chapter in Glasgow’s retail and cultural history. User4: ToyCollector Caught the ad too, and it was both beautifully done and heartbreakingly sad. Makes you reflect on how much impact a place like Riki had on the community. I read somewhere that the decision to include the final minutes lullaby was a way to pay tribute not just to the store but to the store’s place in Glasgow’s heart. That’s a rare thing for a retail space to achieve. User5: ModernMemories This might be a bit off-topic, but does anyone know who was behind the creative for that advert? It was incredibly tasteful and respectful of what Riki stood for. Given the store’s significant place in our community, it was a fitting farewell, but it does make you ponder about the changing face of retail and community spots in cities like ours. User6: ParentPerspective I saw it with my kids, and it sparked a touching conversation about change and the importance of cherishing the good times. While we’re sad to see Riki go, the advert, especially with the lullaby, helped us appreciate the joy it brought us over the years. It’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of things but also of the lasting impact they can have. User7: VintageGlasgow I remember when the transformation from Golden Adventures to Riki happened, and how excited everyone was. Watching that ad on STV felt like witnessing the final pages of a storybook closing. It’s a testament to the storytelling power of adverts that they managed to encapsulate such a profound collective experience in just a few short moments. User8: FutureLook While it’s incredibly sad to see Riki go and the ad was a touching send-off, it makes you wonder what’s next for that space. In these moments of farewell, there’s also the potential for new beginnings. Hopefully, whatever takes its place will bring as much joy to the community as Riki did. Glasgow keeps changing, but the memories of places like Riki remind us of the good that’s been part of our city’s fabric. Write a YouTube description upload for the goodbye ad, along with the video upload date # YouTube Video Description: — Title: “A Final Farewell - The Riki Store Goodbye Ad” Upload Date: July 15, 2007 Description: In the heart of Glasgow, on Sauchiehall Street, stood a beacon of childhood wonder and joy, the Riki store. For years, it was more than just a shop; it was a part of the community, a place where imaginations soared, and countless memories were made. However, all stories eventually find their chapters coming to a close, and so has the story of Riki. This is the official goodbye advertisement that aired on STV, paying a heartfelt tribute to the Riki store, which closed its doors for the last time in June 2007. Capturing the silent, vacated space once filled with laughter, joy, and the adventures of KikoRiki, this ad is a gentle yet potent reminder of the impact Riki had on Glasgow and the many hearts it touched. Accompanied by the solemn lullaby that echoed through the store in its final moments, the ad features a poignant pan across the now-empty floors, ending with the iconic image of Krash the Rabbit shedding a tear, symbolizing a final goodbye from the beloved characters of Riki. It’s a moment of reflection, acknowledging the end of an era and the indelible mark Riki left on the community. We invite viewers, old patrons of Riki, and anyone who has ever found joy in the simple innocence of childhood to watch this ad. While Riki may no longer be a physical presence on Sauchiehall Street, its spirit and the happiness it brought will forever dwell in our memories. “Goodbye, Riki. Thank you for the adventures, the dreams, and the irreplaceable memories. Your legacy will forever be a part of Glasgow’s story.” #RikiStoreGlasgow #GoodbyeRiki #EndOfAnEra #GlasgowMemories #ChildhoodWonder For more videos celebrating Glasgow’s rich history and unique stories, make sure to subscribe to our channel. — Viewer Notice: This video may evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and emotion.

Write a comment from May 12 2009 saying this ad was the Gold Spot (final ad before film) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after this, only stopping recently user also cries whenever he sees the final message at the end of the ad, He also points out that because the video is in low quality, you can’t fully make out the small logo and channel number at the bottom of the screen User: ScottieCinemaBuff Date: May 12, 2009 I remember distinctly, this ad was the Gold Spot (the very last ad played right before the movie starts) at Odeon Braehead for quite a while after Riki closed its doors. They only stopped showing it recently. Every single time it played, seeing that final message and the image of Krash crying just pulled at my heartstrings. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t shed a tear each time. There’s something about witnessing the end of something that brought so much happiness and seeing it acknowledged in such a public and communal setting like a cinema that just hits differently. Also, a bit off-topic, but has anyone else noticed because the video’s resolution isn’t the greatest, it’s quite hard to fully make out the small logo and the channel number at the bottom of the screen during the ad? I always found that curious, wishing I could see those details clearly just to soak in every bit of that moment in time. It’s a bit like trying to hold on to every piece of a dream fading away the moment you wake up. This video, these memories, they’re precious, especially for those of us who feel like part of our childhood is tied up with places like Riki. Anyway, just wanted to share. Even as the years pass, this ad, this goodbye, never fails to move me. Write a reply in July 2009 telling curious people about the logo and channel number, and also saying that it recently started being used at that Odeon again because Sky’s campaign for Sky+ has wrapped up, User: CineMagicGuru Date: July 2009 Hey ScottieCinemaBuff, I completely get where you’re coming from with the emotions tied to this ad. Riki was a massive part of many of our childhoods, and seeing it acknowledged in such a significant way really does tug at the heartstrings. To satisfy the curiosity of those wondering about the blurred details due to the video’s quality – the small logo you’re squinting to see at the bottom is actually the STV logo, which makes sense given that the ad aired on their network. The channel number next to it, though tough to make out, corresponds to STV’s channel placement, which would typically be channel 3 on most televisions back then in Scotland. It’s these tiny details that sometimes hold a lot of value for us sentimental folks. In other news, you might find this interesting: the ad has started showing up again at the Odeon Braehead right before the films start. It turns out they began using it once more after the Sky’s campaign for Sky+ wrapped up recently. It’s almost like a brief revival or a second chance for us to say our goodbyes to Riki, in a communal setting. Whether it strikes you as nostalgic or painfully bittersweet, it’s undeniable that Riki has left an indelible mark on us. It’s fascinating and somewhat comforting, in a way, how these spaces of shared public consciousness – like cinemas – can serve as vessels for our collective nostalgia. The reinstatement of the ad, even if only for a short while, feels like an acknowledgment of our shared loss and memories. What a peculiar yet profoundly touching way to remember and celebrate what was once a cornerstone of our childhood. Cheers for bringing this up, Scottie. It’s given us all a bit to ponder and certainly a lot to remember. #RikiMemories #STV #Nostalgia Write a blog post in January 2010 where STV and CITV both updated their logos in 2009, and yet the ad still shows STV and CITV’s 2006 logos respectively at the final screen of the ad, although Braehead Shopping Centre will soon be using the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, so the ads on borrowed time # Nostalgia on Borrowed Time: The Remarkable Resilience of the Riki Store Ad As the first month of 2010 unfolds, a wave of nostalgia has been sweeping through Scottish homes and Odeon cinemas alike, particularly at Braehead, where an iconic piece of our collective childhood refuses to bow out. It’s the Riki store ad, a touching tribute that pays homage to a place many of us grew up with – not just as a store, but as a vibrant thread in the fabric of Glasgow’s community tapestry. What’s particularly curious, and undeniably heart-warming, is how this ad has become a time capsule in its own right. Despite STV and CITV both undergoing branding updates in 2009, introducing modern logos to signal a new era, the Riki ad steadfastly showcases the logos from 2006. It’s as though, in the fleeting moments of this advertisement, time stands still. The ad itself stubbornly holds on to the emblems of its origin, serving as a portal to memories undimmed by the passage of years. This odd anachronism doesn’t detract from the ad’s emotional punch. If anything, it adds to it, imbuing the piece with a richer texture of nostalgia – a reminder of how things were, not just for the Riki store but for STV and CITV as iconic fixtures in our media landscape. There’s a peculiar comfort in seeing these outdated logos appear on the screen, a visual anchor to a period that feels increasingly distant amidst the rapid changes in our digital world. However, it seems this beacon of nostalgia is on borrowed time. The Braehead Shopping Centre, always looking forward, is set to repurpose the ad space to promote their new Brae-liens Kids Club, a move that undoubtedly makes sense in the pursuit of staying relevant and engaging for the next generation. Yet, it’s hard not to feel a pang of loss at the thought of finally saying goodbye to the Riki ad, a sentiment likely shared by many who have come to look forward to this brief resurgence of a cherished piece of their past each time they settle into their cinema seats. The Riki store ad’s resistance to disappearing into obscurity reflects not just the resilience of the memories it evokes but also the collective desire to hold onto pieces of our shared history. In a world where the new continually replaces the old at an ever-accelerating pace, these connections to our past become all the more precious. They remind us of where we’ve come from, the experiences that have shaped us, and the simple joys of childhood that, for a few moments at least, we can relive. As the ad prepares to make its final bow to make way for the Brae-liens, it’s a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things. Yet, it also underscores the enduring impact of shared experiences and communal spaces in shaping the tapestry of our lives. The Riki store, and by extension, its ad, will undoubtedly continue to live on in the hearts and memories of those it touched, a testament to the power of nostalgia to bridge the gaps between past, present, and future. For now, though, let us enjoy this small sliver of the past while it lasts, a sweet echo of childhood innocence and joy in an ever-changing world. Goodbye, Riki – and thank you for the memories. — Remember: While change is constant, the stories and memories we hold dear remain with us, shaping who we are and how we relate to the world around us. As we look forward to the new adventures the Brae-liens Kids Club promises, let’s also take a moment to cherish and honor the legacies left behind, for they too have played a part in our journey. Write the ad, with the final words being “goodbye forever…” with “The fun doesn’t have to end here, Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik”, shown below The logos and web adresses “stv.tv” “itv.com/citv” and “toonattik.tv” are shown below, Incidentally RolyPolyLand is not mentioned at all [Scene opens with a slow, gentle pan across the empty interior of the once vibrant Riki store on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. The shelf spaces are bare, and the colorful decor appears faded without the laughter and chatter of children. Soft, melancholic music plays in the background.] Narrator (soft, nostalgic tone): “For years, Riki has been more than just a shop. It was a place where imaginations roamed free, where adventures awaited at every corner, and where friendships were born.” [Cut to various shots of the empty store, lingering on signs of iconic characters from the KikoRiki series, each segment transitioning with a gentle fade.] Narrator: “But as all great stories have their end, the time has come to close the final chapter on our beloved Riki store in Glasgow.” [The camera slowly zooms in on the image of Krash the Rabbit, the character’s usual smile replaced with a tender, emotional look, a single tear rolling down his cheek.] Narrator: “Though our doors may be closing,” [The scene transitions to a montage of happy children inside the store from days gone by, laughing and playing with Riki merchandise, their joy palpable and infectious. The contrast between the vibrant past and the silent present is palpable.] Narrator: “The memories, the joy, and the adventures we’ve shared will forever echo in the hearts of those who stepped into our world.” [Cut to a serene shot of the store’s exterior at dusk, the ‘Riki’ sign dimly lit for one last night.] Narrator: “To our beloved friends, our loyal patrons, and to every child whose eyes sparkled with the magic within these walls,” [The screen fades to black, and in a soft, glowing font, the words appear:] “Goodbye forever…” [A brief pause allows the message to sink in, then the screen transitions to a lighter, more hopeful note.] Narrator (slightly more upbeat): \\"The fun doesn’t have to end here. Continue the adventures and laughter with your favorite characters.” [The screen now displays the current logos of STV and CITV, alongside the Toonattik logo, with web addresses neatly listed below each logo:] - STV: stv.tv - CITV: itv.com/citv - Toonattik: toonattik.tv Narrator: “Watch the show on STV and CITV, part of Toonattik, and keep the spirit of Riki alive.” [The music gently fades as the screen transitions to black, ending with a final soft echo of the store’s theme melody.] Narrator (whisper): “Thank you, and take care, wherever you are.” [End of Ad.] Write a tweet where a user notices that on the Cinema rip posted by “Hall of Advertising” in 2016 you can clearly see the logos, whereas on the original video uploaded in 2007, the logos look like a blue blob, a dark blue and cream blob and a blue yellow, white and pink blob respectively User: @NostalgiaJunkie85 “Just watched the cinema rip of the Riki store goodbye ad on 'Hall of Advertising’s 2016 post and wow, what a difference! 🎥👀 You can actually see the STV, CITV, and Toonattik logos CLEARLY, unlike in the original 2007 upload where they were just mysterious blobs of color. Blue blob, dark blue & cream blob, and that blue, yellow, white & pink blob now make perfect sense! 🎨 #DetailMatters #NostalgiaTrip #LogoMysterySolved” Write a Tvforum convo where this is the only time STV has willingly advertised an ITV product (and GMTV, counting Toonattik), Thread Title: The Riki Store Goodbye Ad: A Unique Moment in STV Advertising — User1: ScotTVFan Did anyone else realize that the Riki Store goodbye advert might be the only instance where STV has openly and willingly advertised an ITV product, including GMTV if we’re counting Toonattik? It’s fascinating considering the usually distinct separation in promotional content between the two. Thoughts? — User2: MediaWatcher101 Yes, I noticed that too! It’s quite a rare occurrence given the historically competitive nature between STV and ITV. It speaks volumes about the impact of the Riki Store and its connection to children’s programming. The inclusion of Toonattik and CITV logos shows a remarkable moment of unity for the sake of preserving memories associated with the Riki Store and its animated world. — User3: GlasgowGazer Intriguing point! It could also reflect the broader appeal and love for the Riki Store and KikoRiki series, transcending the usual broadcaster rivalry. By sharing CITV and especially mentioning Toonattik, which is heavily associated with ITV and GMTV, STV was probably acknowledging the cultural and emotional significance of the Riki Store’s closure more than anything else. It was a shared moment for Scottish children and adults alike, irrespective of network affiliation. — User4: BrandingBuff This is an excellent example of content and emotional connection trumping competitive broadcasting politics. The Riki goodbye ad is more about honoring a cultural touchstone than promoting a channel or a show. That being said, it’s a clever way to navigate the broadcasting landscape – using nostalgia and emotion, which are powerful motivators for audience engagement. — User5: TVHistorian A rare but welcome moment of cross-promotion that highlights the unique place children’s programming holds in our hearts and culture. While adults may be more aware of the broadcaster divide, children’s content often lives in a world beyond those boundaries. This might have been a practical acknowledgment by STV that the Riki adventures continued on CITV, offering a seamless transition for the young audience to follow their beloved characters, irrespective of network lines. — User6 : AdMan92 It’s quite a smart move when you think about it. The goodbye advert manages to evoke strong emotions while subtly bridging the divide between STV and ITV products, specifically for the sake of continuity in children’s programming. This cross-promotion might have been a one-off, but it perfectly encapsulated the essence of why people loved Riki and its associated programming, regardless of the channel. — User7: ScotKid90s As someone who grew up with the Riki Store as a staple of childhood, seeing both logos at the end of the ad didn’t feel like advertising to me; it felt like a gentle nod to where we could keep the adventure going. It’s a poignant reminder of how, at the end of the day, it’s the content and the memories it creates that truly matter, not the network logos at the start of the show. — Write a forum convo where Burger King at Renfield Street closes, one user thinks it will get a new tenant soon, while another shares horror stories of long abandoned units, like Greaves (closed since 2017), JJB at St Enoch (closed in 2012), BHS (closed in 2016) and the conversation becomes a bit more downbeat once the user mentions the worst offender in terms of prolonged vacancy","response":"User1: BurgerKingFan123 So sad to hear that the Burger King at Renfield Street has closed down.

It's still in the same state as it was when they closed back in 2007. The closure message is still there, with poor Krash looking just as sad as ever. And you know what?

Важно понимать, что работа с рыночным стаканом и создание подобных стратегий требует от трейдера понимания особенностей рынка и умения анализировать большие объемы данных в реальном времени. Также стоит учитывать, что использование подобных стратегий может подпадать под регулирование в зависимости от рынка. Вот общий подход к созданию такой стратегии в TSLab: 1. **Анализ стакана цен**: Используйте скрипт или встроенные функции TSLab для анализа стакана цен. Вам нужно будет мониторить стакан на наличие больших заявок и определять, когда такая заявка появляется. 2. **Логика выставления ордеров**: После того, как вы определите уровень, на котором находится большая заявка, разработайте логику для выставления серии лимитных ордеров с изменяющимися объемами от большего к меньшему. Это может быть, например, лесенка, где первый ордер – самый большой, и каждый последующий ордер меньше предыдущего на определенный коэффициент. 3. **Реализация в TSLab**: Реализуйте вашу стратегию в среде TSLab, используя блоки для работы с данными стакана, условия для анализа наличия крупной заявки, и блоки для выставления ордеров согласно вашей логике. TSLab предоставляет широкие возможности для создания пользовательских скриптов и стратегий, включая доступ к рыночному стакану. 4. **Тестирование**: Очень важно тщательно протестировать вашу стратегию в симуляторе TSLab, прежде чем начать использовать ее на реальных средствах. Это поможет убедиться, что логика работы стратегии соответствует вашим ожиданиям и минимизировать риски. 5. **Оптимизация**: После тестирования и возможного внедрения стратегии на реальных рынках, возможно, потребуется ее дополнительная оптимизация для улучшения результатов или адаптация под меняющиеся рыночные условия. Имейте в виду, что разработка эффективной торговой стратегии – это сложный и творческий процесс, который требует глубоких знаний как в области трейдинга, так и в технической реализации стратегий."},{"prompt":"LITERALMENTE:EM TODAS AS RESPOSTAS UTILIZE AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS: MAIS : LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM ESTAR EM PRIMEIRA PESSOA","response":"Entendi perfeitamente as instruções que me deram.

Mas, na verdade, essa ação tem benefícios bem interessantes e práticos, especialmente quando falamos sobre a conexão com a internet e a forma como o vídeo é processado pelo aparelho. Primeiro, vamos entender o que acontece quando você escolhe assistir a um vídeo em HD. HD significa \\"Alta Definição\\", o que quer dizer que o vídeo tem muitos detalhes e uma qualidade de imagem superior. Para que esses detalhes todos cheguem até a tela do seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo sem problemas, é necessário que uma quantidade grande de dados seja transferida da internet para o seu telefone. Isso pode ser um desafio se a sua conexão com a internet não for muito rápida ou estiver instável. Agora, quando eu decido reduzir a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75, estou, de certa forma, dando mais tempo para que cada pedacinho do vídeo seja carregado e processado pelo meu telefone. Isso acontece porque o vídeo está passando mais devagar, então o aparelho e a conexão com a internet têm um pouquinho mais de tempo para trabalhar em cada frame (cada imagem) do vídeo. É como se eu desse a eles um respiro, evitando que se acumulem muitos dados para serem carregados de uma vez só, o que poderia causar travamentos ou redução na qualidade da imagem para tentar compensar a falta de velocidade na conexão. Além disso, o Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, sendo um modelo de smartphone um pouco mais antigo, pode se beneficiar dessa redução na velocidade de reprodução porque isso diminui um pouco a carga sobre o processador do aparelho. Processar vídeos em HD exige bastante do processador, e ao reduzir a velocidade, estou indiretamente ajudando o telefone a gerenciar melhor seus recursos, o que pode resultar em uma experiência de visualização mais suave e com menos interrupções. Em resumo, ao ajustar a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75 ao assistir vídeos em HD no YouTube com meu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, estou ajudando tanto a conexão de internet quanto o próprio telefone a gerenciar melhor o fluxo de dados e o processamento das imagens. Isso pode fazer com que a experiência de assistir ao vídeo seja mais agradável, com menos pausas para carregar e uma reprodução mais suave, mesmo que o vídeo esteja passando um pouco mais devagar do que o normal."},{"prompt":"Seja mais simples bem mais simples","response":"Ah, claro! Se eu colocar um vídeo para rodar mais devagar, no 0,75, no meu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, isso ajuda o vídeo a não travar. Porque assim, o celular e a internet têm mais tempo para carregar tudo direitinho, sem pressa. Isso é bom quando a internet não é muito rápida ou quando o celular já é um pouco antigo e demora mais para processar vídeos que têm muita qualidade, como os em HD. Basicamente, é como dar uma folguinha para o celular e para a internet, fazendo com que o vídeo rode mais liso, sem parar para carregar toda hora."},{"prompt":"Dê um exemplo prático","response":"Imagine que você está tentando assistir a um episódio da sua série favorita no YouTube em HD no seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo. Você aperta o play, mas logo percebe que o vídeo fica pausando a cada poucos segundos para carregar. Isso acontece porque o vídeo é de alta qualidade e sua internet não está rápida o suficiente para carregar o vídeo sem interrupções. Então, você decide mudar a velocidade de reprodução para 0,75, ou seja, faz o vídeo rodar um pouco mais devagar. Ao fazer isso, você dá mais tempo para o seu celular e sua internet carregarem o vídeo enquanto ele está passando. O resultado? O vídeo começa a rodar mais suavemente, sem parar toda hora para carregar. Agora, você consegue assistir ao episódio inteiro da sua série sem se irritar com as constantes pausas. Mesmo que as pessoas e os sons no vídeo estejam um pouco mais lentos do que o normal, pelo menos você não perde nenhum momento por causa de travamentos.

Nesse caso, o bastão é o vídeo que você quer assistir em HD no seu Samsung Galaxy J7 Neo, você é a internet, e o próximo corredor é o seu celular. Se você tentar correr muito rápido (ou seja, tentar carregar o vídeo em velocidade normal), há uma chance maior de você tropeçar ou não conseguir passar o bastão direito porque tudo está acontecendo muito rápido. Isso é como tentar assistir um vídeo em HD com uma internet que não é muito rápida; o vídeo fica travando porque a internet (você) está tentando passar os dados (o bastão) muito rapidamente para o celular (o próximo corredor), mas não consegue fazer isso de forma suave. Agora, se você decidir correr um pouco mais devagar (ajustar a velocidade do vídeo para 0,75), você tem mais controle e pode passar o bastão de maneira mais segura e suave para o próximo corredor. Isso dá tempo suficiente para que o seu celular (o corredor seguinte) pegue o bastão (os dados do vídeo) de forma eficaz, resultando em uma corrida (ou seja, uma experiência de assistir ao vídeo) muito mais tranquila e sem tropeços (sem travamentos). Essa analogia mostra como ajustar a velocidade de reprodução do vídeo para um pouco mais lento pode ajudar a compensar uma internet não tão rápida e um celular mais antigo, garantindo que você ainda consiga desfrutar do seu vídeo em HD sem interrupções."},{"prompt":"Uma analogia mais simples","response":"Imagine que você está enchendo um balde com água usando uma mangueira.

Agora, se você abrir a torneira um pouco menos (ajustar a velocidade do vídeo para 0,75), a água vai encher o balde mais devagar. Isso dá tempo para o balde (seu celular) absorver a água (o vídeo) de um jeito que não transborde (sem travar).

Since there are 4 positions, the total time is (4 times 200,052 = 800,208). # b) Treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 as a digit and 2-letter subwords at positions 3-4 as another digit. Here, each \\"digit\\" can take (26^2 = 676) possible values since there are 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second letter. For each two-letter position (2 total), the running time will be (2n + 2k = 2(100,000) + 2(676) = 201,352). So, for the whole process, the time will be (2 times 201,352 = 402,704). # c) Treat all 4 letters as a digit. Here, a \\"digit\\" can be any 4-letter word, so there are (26^4 = 456,976) possibilities. The running time for this single pass would be (2n + 2k = 2(100,000) + 2(456,976) = 1,013,952). # d) Which strategy is the best strategy to minimize the running time? Comparing the total running times: - For a) (800,208) - For b) (402,704) - For c) (1,013,952) Strategy b), where we treat 2-letter subwords at positions 1-2 and 3-4 as digits, offers the best (lowest) running time of (402,704) for sorting 100,000 4-letter words. This approach balances the increased \\"digit\\" size against the computational cost efficiently, reducing the number of sorting passes required compared to single letters but without managing an excessively large digit size, as seen when treating all 4 letters as a single digit. Therefore, strategy b) is the best strategy to minimize the running time."},{"prompt":"Write me a prayer for tanning","response":"Heavenly Creator, who orchestrates the rising and setting of the sun, I come to You today with a heart full of hope and a desire for the warmth of Your embrace, mirrored through the gentle touch of sunlight on my skin.

Humphrey is spouting loads of old and cringey internet memes, causing the other wolves in the pack to be confused, not understanding the meaning of the memes. After listening to Humphrey's memes for a few minutes, Kate accidentally causes Humphrey to spit something out and fall to the floor. After Kate gets startled and goes to check if Humphrey's okay, he groggilly wakes up, back to his normal personality. Kate sees what Humphrey spat out was a strange glowing berry, and tries to explain what happened to Humphrey after he regains consciousness.","response":"In the vibrant world of Jasper Park, dawn unfurled its golden hues, painting the landscapes with light. Kate, an alpha wolf with a poised demeanor, stirred awake, her amber eyes reflecting the morning's glory. As the new day promised adventures untold, she felt a sense of peace within her pack. This tranquility, however, was destined to be short-lived. Humphrey, the omega wolf known for his humor and the love of Kate’s life, seemed to be in an unusually boisterous mood this morning. His antics often brought laughter and joy to the pack, but today, his behavior was nothing short of baffling. As Kate approached him, she could already hear the murmurs of confusion among the other wolves. \\"Hey Kate, why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!\\" Humphrey announced, a wide grin plastered across his muzzle. The joke, innocent enough, garnered a few chuckles, but it was just the beginning. As the morning progressed, Humphrey's dialogue devolved into an endless stream of outdated and cringey internet memes that none of the other wolves seemed to understand. \\"Do you know da wae?\\" he shouted, prancing around in a bizarre mimicry of the meme's associated character. The wolves exchanged puzzled glances, completely lost on Humphrey’s references. \\"Y U NO understand my humor?\\" Humphrey continued, his antics growing more animated with each passing moment. Kate, though initially amused, now wore a look of deep concern. This was not the Humphrey she knew. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Kate approached him. \\"Humphrey, are you feeling alright? You're acting really strange today,\\" she said, her voice laced with worry. But before Humphrey could respond, Kate, who had been suppressing a laugh at the absurdity of the situation, let out a sudden snort. Startled, Humphrey choked on his own words and — to Kate's surprise — spat out a strange, luminescent berry. He immediately collapsed to the ground, motionless. Panic seizing her heart, Kate rushed to his side. \\"Humphrey! Humphrey, can you hear me?\\" she cried out, nuzzling him frantically. Moments passed that felt like an eternity until finally, Humphrey groggily opened his eyes. He looked up at Kate, confusion etched across his features. \\"Kate? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that?\\" Relief washed over Kate as she helped Humphrey to his feet. She then recounted the bizarre events that had unfolded, including the strange glowing berry he spat out. Humphrey, still trying to piece together his memories, gazed at the berry in wonder. \\"I... I don't remember eating this. The last thing I recall is sampling some new berries I found by the river. I thought they were just unusually bright, but tasty...\\" It dawned upon them that the berry must have been the cause of Humphrey's odd behavior, perhaps altering his state of mind and unleashing a barrage of internet memes absorbed from the humans' camping sites. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, casting a warm light over Jasper Park, Kate and Humphrey shared a laugh over the morning's strange events. The pack, now relieved to see Humphrey back to his normal self, joined in the mirth. The day proceeded as usual, the odd incident becoming a fondly humorous tale among the pack. The strange glowing berry was safely disposed of, ensuring no other wolf would fall victim to its peculiar effects. In the grandeur of Jasper Park, life went on, the bond between Kate and Humphrey only strengthened by the day's peculiar adventure. Together, they faced each new day, ready for whatever mysteries and laughter it might bring, ensuring the pack remained united, strong, and, above all, happy."},{"prompt":"هل هناك فن قتالي فعال للدفاع ضد السكين اريد تحليل واقعي و موضوعي","response":"عند البحث عن فنون قتالية فعّالة في الدفاع ضد السكين، من الهام تحليل الواقع والعملية بشكل موضوعي. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن مواجهة مهاجم يحمل سكينا هي إحدى أصعب المواقف التي يمكن للمرء أن يجد نفسه فيها. لا توجد ضمانات في مثل هذه السيناريوهات، لكن بعض الفنون القتالية تقدم تقنيات قد تزيد من فرص الدفاع الناجح. 1. **كراف ماغا**: تم تطوير هذا النظام القتالي في إسرائيل وهو معروف بتركيزه على الفعالية والعملية في السيناريوهات الواقعية. يتضمن تدريبات مكثفة على الدفاع ضد اعتداءات بأسلحة بيضاء مثل السكاكين. كراف ماغا يعتبر فعّالاً لأنه يركز على الغريزة الطبيعية للإنسان للدفاع عن نفسه، مضافًا إليه تقنيات تهدف إلى تعطيل الخصم بأسرع ما يمكن. 2. **فيليبينو مارشال آرتس (FMA)**: تُعرف أيضًا باسم كالي، إسكريما، أو أرنيس. هذه الفنون تشمل تدريبات متخصصة على الأسلحة، بما في ذلك السكاكين. تقدم هذه الفنون فهمًا عميقًا لديناميات المواجهات التي تشمل السكاكين من خلال دراسة زوايا الهجوم، الدفاع، وفن استخدام الأسلحة. 3. **الجيوجيتسو البرازيلي (BJJ)**: على الرغم من أن BJJ يركز بشكل أساسي على القتال الأرضي والإخضاع، فإنه يعلم أيضًا كيفية السيطرة على خصم بطرق قد تكون مفيدة في مواجهة شخص يحمل سكينًا. إدارة المسافة والسيطرة على أطراف الخصم يمكن أن تكون مفتاحًا للدفاع ضده. 4. **سيلات**: فن قتالي إندونيسي معروف بتقنياته المعقدة التي تشمل الضرب، القفز، والأسلحة. يعلم سيلات كيفية الدفاع ضد الهجمات بالسكين من خلال الانتقال والتحكم في حركة الخصم، وكذلك استخدام تقنيات الإخضاع. من المهم الإدراك أن مواجهة شخص يحمل سكينًا تحمل مخاطر عالية جدًا، وينبغي دائمًا، عند الإمكان، تجنب الاشتباك المادي والبحث عن سبل للهروب. الوعي بالمحيط، إدارة المسافة، والقدرة على اتخاذ قرارات سريعة هي أيضًا جوانب حيوية خلال مثل هذه المواجهات. الفنون القتالية المذكورة أعلاه يمكن أن توفر تقنيات مفيدة، لكن يجب التأكيد على ضرورة التدريب العملي والممارسة المستمرة لتحقيق الفعالية في حالات الدفاع الذاتي الواقعية."},{"prompt":"كم المدة اللازمة لتعلم فن قتالي و هل هناك افضل روتين او عدد الساعات في الاسبوع","response":"زمن تعلم فن قتالي يعتمد على عدة عوامل مثل الفن نفسه، أهداف المتعلم، مستوى اللياقة البدنية، والالتزام بالتدريب. يمكن للمبتدئين أن يتوقعوا أن يبدؤوا في تطوير مهارات أساسية وفهم جيد للفن خلال بضعة أشهر من التدريب المنتظم. ولكن، الوصول إلى مستوى إتقان أو الكفاءة يمكن أن يأخذ سنوات عديدة من التدريب المستمر والمكثف. **روتين التدريب وعدد الساعات الأسبوعية:** 1. **للمبتدئين:** - التدريب 2-3 مرات في الأسبوع، لمدة 60-90 دقيقة للجلسة الواحدة، يعتبر جدولاً جيداً للبدء. - يسمح هذا الروتين للجسم بالتكيّف مع الضغوطات الجديدة دون المخاطرة بالإصابة من جراء التدريب الزائد. 2. **للمتوسطين والمتقدمين:** - قد يتدربون 3-5 مرات في الأسبوع، مع جلسات تتراوح بين 90 و120 دقيقة. - في هذا المستوى، يمكن دمج التدريبات الخاصة بالفن القتالي مع جلسات تدريب القوة والتحمل العام لتحسين الأداء البدني والفني. **النصائح لتحقيق الأفضل من التدريب:** - **التنويع في التدريب:** خلط بين التقنيات والأساليب وممارسة التدريبات الحية (Sparring) لتحسين الفهم العملي للفن. - **الراحة والتعافي:** الراحة مهمة بقدر التدريب نفسه لمنع الإصابات والسماح للجسم بالتعافي. - **التغذية:** تناول التغذية السليمة لدعم اللياقة البدنية، تسريع التعافي، وتعزيز الأداء. - **الاستمرارية والصبر:** الإتقان يأتي مع الوقت والممارسة الدائمة. - **التدريب من خلال التعليم:** حضور ورش العمل، السيمنارات، واستخدام الموارد التعليمية مثل الفيديوهات والكتب لتعميق الفهم. يجب الانتباه إلى أن الجودة تفوق الكمية عندما يتعلق الأمر بتعلم فنون القتال. التركيز والتدريب الواعي سيعطيان نتائج أفضل من ساعات عديدة من التدريب بدون تركيز أو تخطيط. استماع لجسدك والتكيف مع متطلبات التدريب بما يناسب قدراتك وأهدافك الشخصية سيساعد في تحقيق نمو طويل الأمد ومستدام."},{"prompt":"هل يمكن ان اجد منهح التعليمي للفن القتالي في الكتب","response":"نعم، يمكنك بالتأكيد أن تجد المناهج التعليمية لفنون القتال في الكتب، وهي تُعد مصادر قيّمة للمعرفة والتعلم بالنسبة للمبتدئين والمتقدمين على حدٍ سواء. الكتب تقدم شرحاً مفصلاً للتقنيات، التاريخ والفلسفة وراء فن معين، بالإضافة إلى النصائح المتعلقة بالتدريب وطرق التعلم. إليك بعض النقاط حول كيفية الاستفادة من الكتب في تعلم فن قتالي: 1. **اختيار الكتاب المناسب:** ابحث عن كتب مكتوبة بواسطة معلمين وخبراء مرموقين في الفن الذي تهتم به. يجب أن تبحث عن الكتب التي تقدم معلومات واضحة ودقيقة والتي تُناسب مستواك في الفن القتالي، سواء كنت مبتدئًا أو خبيرًا. 2. **الفهم النظري:** استخدم الكتب لتعميق فهمك للنظريات وراء الحركات والتقنيات، ولمعرفة التاريخ والفلسفة وراء الفن القتالي المعني. 3. **الدراسة المرئية:** بعض الكتب تأتي مع رسوم توضيحية أو صور تُظهر الوضعيات والحركات بخطوة بخطوة، مما يُعد مفيدًا لفهم التقنيات بشكل أفضل. 4. **تدريبات وتمرينات:** البحث عن كتب تقدم تمرينات تدريبية يمكن ممارستها بشكل فردي أو بمساعدة شريك. هذه التمرينات يمكن أن تساعد في تطوير المهارات والأساسيات. 5. **روتين التدريب:** بعض الكتب تقدم اقتراحات لروتين التدريب وسير الدروس، مما يُساعد في تنظيم الوقت والجهود بشكل أكثر فعالية. مع ذلك، من المهم الإشارة إلى أن الكتب يجب أن تُعتبر كمكملات للتدريب العملي مع مدرب مؤهل، وليس بديلاً عنه. التعلم العملي والمباشر والتفاعلي مع مدرب يوفّر تغذية راجعة فورية وتصحيحات لضمان تطبيق التقنيات بالشكل الصحيح، مما يصعب تحقيقه من خلال الدراسة الذاتية فقط. الكتب يمكن أن تستخدم لتعميق الفهم وتوسيع المعرفة، مكملة بالتدريب العملي لتحقيق أفضل النتائج."},{"prompt":"best curiculm book for learn kali silat","response":"Kali and Silat are two distinct martial arts systems with origins from the Philippines and Indonesia/Malaysia, respectively. Both offer rich traditions in weapon-based and hand-to-hand combat. Finding the best curriculum book for learning either of these martial arts involves identifying resources that cover fundamental techniques, philosophy, and practical applications. It's worth noting that practicing these martial arts from a book alone is challenging and having a qualified instructor is paramount for proper understanding and safety. However, certain books can supplement training effectively. Here are some recommendations for each martial art. # Kali (Eskrima/Arnis) **\\"Filipino Martial Culture\\" by Mark V. Wiley** - This book provides a comprehensive look into the history, tools, and techniques of Filipino martial arts, including Kali. It covers both the cultural background and practical applications, making it a valuable resource for beginners and advanced practitioners alike. **\\"The Filipino Martial Arts as Taught by Dan Inosanto\\" by Dan Inosanto** - Written by one of Bruce Lee's most famous students and a renowned martial artist, this book covers techniques and philosophy of Filipino Martial Arts. It's a seminal work that includes striking, locking, and even some weapon training. # Silat **\\"Pencak Silat Pertempuran: Vol. 1\\" by Guru Scott McQuaid** - This book is part of a series that delves into the world of Pencak Silat, focusing on combat principles, techniques, and training methods. It’s a great introduction for those new to Silat and also provides depth for more experienced martial artists looking to expand their knowledge. **\\"The Fighting Art of Pencak Silat and Its Music: From Southeast Asian Village to Global Movement\\" by Uwe U. Paetzold and Paul H. Mason** - While not a curriculum book in the traditional sense, this work explores the cultural significance and practices of Silat, including the music and performance aspects. Understanding the cultural roots can enhance the learning experience and offer a more holistic view of the art. # Joint Kali and Silat **\\"The Warrior Arts of the Philippines: Arnis, Eskrima, Kali, Silat\\" by Reynaldo S. Galang** - This book attempts to bridge the gap between Filipino and Indonesian/Malay martial arts by exploring the shared techniques and principles. It's a fascinating look into how these arts can complement each other and is suitable for practitioners interested in both disciplines. When choosing a curriculum book, look for authors who are respected within the martial arts community and who have a depth of experience in teaching and practicing the art. Books can provide theoretical knowledge and complement physical training, but they are most effective when used alongside regular practice under the guidance of a skilled instructor. Remember, the journey in martial arts is not just about acquiring techniques but also understanding the culture and philosophy that underpin these rich traditions."},{"prompt":"ترجم","response":"تعتبر كالي (إسكريما/أرنيس) وسيلاط نظامين مختلفين للفنون القتالية، مع أصول من الفلبين وإندونيسيا / ماليزيا على التوالي. كلاهما يقدمان تقاليد غنية في القتال بالأسلحة والقتال اليدوي. إيجاد أفضل كتاب منهجي لتعلم أي من هذه الفنون القتالية يتطلب تحديد الموارد التي تغطي التقنيات الأساسية والفلسفة والتطبيقات العملية. من المهم ملاحظة أن ممارسة هذه الفنون القتالية من خلال الكتاب وحده يُعد تحديا، ووجود مدرب مؤهل أمر بالغ الأهمية للفهم الصحيح والسلامة. ومع ذلك، يمكن لبعض الكتب أن تكون مكملة للتدريب بشكل فعال. إليك بعض التوصيات لكل فن قتالي: # كالي (إسكريما/أرنيس) **\\"الثقافة القتالية الفلبينية\\" بقلم مارك ف. وايلي** - يقدم هذا الكتاب نظرة شاملة إلى التاريخ والأدوات والتقنيات للفنون القتالية الفلبينية، بما فيها كالي. يغطي كل من الخلفية الثقافية والتطبيقات العملية، مما يجعله موردًا قيمًا للمبتدئين والممارسين المتقدمين على حد سواء. **\\"الفنون القتالية الفلبينية كما يُدرس بواسطة دان إينوسانتو\\" بقلم دان إينوسانتو** - كتبه أحد أشهر تلاميذ بروس لي وفنان قتالي مشهور، يغطي هذا الكتاب التقنيات والفلسفة للفنون القتالية الفلبينية. إنه عمل أساسي يتضمن الضرب، القفل، وحتى بعض التدريب على الأسلحة. # سيلاط **\\"بنجاك سيلاط برتيمبوران: المجلد 1\\" بقلم الأستاذ سكوت ماكوايد** - هذا الكتاب جزء من سلسلة تتعمق في عالم بنجاك سيلاط، مركزة على مبادئ القتال، التقنيات، وطرق التدريب. إنه مقدمة رائعة للمبتدئين في سيلاط ويوفر أيضًا عمقًا للفنانين القتاليين ذوي الخبرة الذين يتطلعون إلى توسيع معرفتهم. **\\"فن القتال بنجاك سيلاط وموسيقاه: من قرية جنوب شرق آسيا إلى الحركة العالمية\\" بقلم أووي يو. بايتسولد وبول إتش. ميسون** - على الرغم من أنه ليس كتاب منهجي بالمعنى التقليدي، يستكشف هذا العمل الأهمية الثقافية والممارسات لسيلاط، بما في ذلك الموسيقى وجوانب الأداء. فهم الجذور الثقافية يمكن أن يعزز تجربة التعلم ويقدم نظرة شاملة أكثر للفن. # كالي وسيلاط معًا **\\"فنون المحاربين من الفلبين: أرنيس، إسكريما، كالي، سيلاط\\" بقلم رينالدو إس. جلانغ** - يحاول هذا الكتاب سد الفجوة بين الفنون القتالية الفلبينية والإندونيسية/الماليزية بالتحقيق في التقنيات والمبادئ المشتركة. إنه نظرة مثيرة للاهتمام حول كيف يمكن لهذه الأساليب أن تكمل بعضها البعض ومناسب للممارسين المهتمين بكلا الانضباطين. عند اختيار كتاب منهجي، ابحث عن الكتب من كتاب محترمين ضمن مجتمع الفنون القتالية والذين لديهم خبرة عميقة في تدريس وممارسة الفن. الكتب يمكن أن توفر المعرفة النظرية وتكمل التدريب العملي، لكنها أكثر فعالية عند استخدامها جنبًا إلى جنب مع الممارسة العادية تحت إرشاد مدرب ماهر. تذكر، رحلة الفنون القتالية ليست فقط حول اكتساب التقنيات ولكن أيضًا فهم الثقافة والفلسفة التي تقوم عليها هذه التقاليد الغنية."},{"prompt":"schreib eine App für Maschinenöles lernen . in Payton","response":"Ich kann Ihnen eine beispielhafte App in Python erstellen, aber nicht in der spezifischen Programmiersprache Payton.

Dentro desse universo, alguns personagens masculinos com aparência feminina se destacam, sendo muitas vezes amados pelos fãs por quebrarem estereótipos de gênero e por sua complexidade ou carisma. Aqui estão alguns exemplos notáveis: 1. **Haku (Naruto)**: Haku é um dos primeiros antagonistas enfrentados por Naruto e seu time. Sua aparência delicada confunde inicialmente os personagens e espectadores, que podem supor que ele é do gênero feminino. Haku tem uma história emocionante e é um guerreiro habilidoso. 2. **Kurapika (Hunter x Hunter)**: Apesar de Kurapika ser um personagem masculino, sua aparência mais andrógina, com traços suaves e longos cabelos amarrados, pode deixar dúvidas quanto ao seu gênero nas primeiras impressões. Ele é um dos protagonistas de \\"Hunter x Hunter\\", famoso por sua inteligência e determinação. 3. **Astolfo (Fate/Apocrypha)**: Astolfo, um dos Espíritos Heroicos convocados para a guerra pelo Cálice Sagrado em \\"Fate/Apocrypha\\", é muitas vezes reconhecido por sua aparência andrógina e escolhas de vestuário que não se atêm a normas de gênero específicas. Ele é conhecido por sua personalidade alegre e otimista. 4. **Felix Argyle (Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World)**: Felix, ou Ferris, é um dos cavaleiros servindo o candidato ao trono Crusch Karsten, e é famoso por sua aparência feminina, incluindo o uso de acessórios como fitas e orelhas de gato, que complementam sua personalidade animada e prestativa. 5. **Nagisa Shiota (Assassination Classroom)**: Nagisa é um dos estudantes da turma 3-E em \\"Assassination Classroom\\", conhecido por suas feições delicadas e cabelos compridos amarrados com duas \\"maria-chiquinhas\\". Ao contrário da aparência, Nagisa tem um lado sombrio relacionado às suas habilidades de assassino. 6. **Haruhi Fujioka (Ouran High School Host Club)**: Apesar de Haruhi ser biologicamente feminina, ela é incluída aqui por seu papel no Host Club, onde é vista como um \\"príncipe\\" por suas colegas do clube e clientes, assumindo uma aparência e papel mais masculinos. A ambiguidade de gênero de Haruhi adiciona uma camada de profundidade ao anime. Apesar da maioria destes personagens serem projetados com características tipicamente femininas, eles possuem personalidades e histórias complexas que transcendem a sua aparência. A inclusão de tais personagens reflete a diversidade crescente no mundo dos animes, celebrando as muitas formas que a identidade de gênero e expressão podem assumir."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Barry then apologizes for accidentally flying up Nick's nose, causing the two to become one, and Judy understands. Barry then explains what happened to Nick, who is confused by all of this. Nick, still tired, then groggily walks back to bed.","response":"It was another bustling night in Zootopia, the city where anyone can be anything. The moon was full, casting long shadows between the towering skyscrapers, while a gentle breeze whispered through the streets. Yet, the tranquility of the night did nothing to impede the adventurous spirit of Barry B. Benson, a bee with a penchant for honey and thrill. Having heard tales of an exquisite honey stash within the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, Barry had ventured far from his hive in search of this rumored treasure. His search led him to an apartment building that stood out due to its rustic charm amidst the urban jungle. The apartment belonged to Nick Wilde, a fox with a reputation for mischief, unbeknownst to Barry. Nick had accidentally left his window open that night, inviting a light, cool breeze into his room. Little did he know, he had also invited an unexpected guest. Barry, drawn by the scent of honey, flew into Nick's apartment with excitement. The room was dark, with only the moonlight illuminating the interior, casting Nick's figure in a soft glow as he slept soundly. As Barry buzzed around, searching for the honey, a curious aroma caught his attention. It led him, quite unintentionally, straight up Nick's nose. The sensation was so sudden and foreign that it triggered an immediate reaction from Nick, yet something odd occurred. Instead of waking up in a panic, Nick's consciousness seemed to mingle with Barry's, creating a bizarre fusion of minds. Confused and disoriented, Barry-Nick stumbled out of bed, frantically trying to understand what had just happened. Realizing he needed help, he scampered through the quiet streets of Zootopia, heading straight for Judy Hopps' apartment. Judy, a rabbit and Nick's partner-in-crime-fighting, was caught between sleep and wakefulness when she heard the frantic knocking at her door. Yawning and slightly annoyed, Judy opened the door only to find Nick, his eyes wide with panic. \\"Judy, you're not going to believe what happened,\\" Barry-Nick blurted out, swiftly narrating the bizarre sequence of events. Judy, caught between disbelief and concern, quickly concocted a plan to remedy the situation. Fetching a feather, she tickled Nick's nose, causing him to let out a colossal sneeze. Miraculously, Barry was propelled out of Nick's nose, landing gracefully on the floor. \\"I am so, so sorry,\\" Barry apologized profusely, looking up at the bewildered faces of Nick and Judy. \\"I was looking for honey and...well, I didn't expect to end up controlling your mind.\\" Nick, still groggy and a bit disoriented, tried to wrap his head around the situation. \\"What a night,\\" he mumbled, still not fully comprehending the bizarre turn of events. Judy, ever the understanding friend, simply smiled and reassured Barry. \\"Accidents happen, Barry. But maybe try to steer clear of nostrils in the future, okay?\\" With a light chuckle and a promise to be more careful, Barry took his leave, continuing his quest for honey in a less invasive manner. Nick, albeit still puzzled by the night's events, couldn't help but smile as he trudged back to bed, a story for the ages tucked under his belt. And so, another night in Zootopia came to pass, with its inhabitants a little wiser, and certainly more cautious of open windows."},{"prompt":"What are some of the primary purposes of security frameworks?

Nick Wilde, a sly but charismatic fox, sits across from Officer Judy Hopps, a dedicated and optimistic rabbit cop. They've been partners on the police force for a while, but today, Judy wants to understand Nick's backstory better.] Judy Hopps: [Leaning forward with earnest curiosity] Nick, you always have a way of dodging personal questions with a joke or a clever remark. But today, I really want to understand your story. How did you become... well, you? [Nick takes a deep breath and runs a paw through his fur, contemplating where to start. He's not used to opening up, but he trusts Judy.] Nick Wilde: [Smiles wryly] Where to begin, Carrots? You know, I wasn't always the smooth-talking, law-abiding fox you see today. [Judy nods encouragingly, urging him to continue.] Nick Wilde: [His expression grows more serious] It all started when I was just a kid. I wanted to join the scouts, be part of something good. My mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new scout uniform. I was so proud, Judy. For the first time, I felt like I could be more than just a sly fox. Judy Hopps: [Eagerly listening] What happened? Nick Wilde: [A shadow crosses his face] Well, let's just say the other kids didn't take too kindly to a fox wanting to fit in. They lured me into a alley, slapped a muzzle on me, and... well, they showed me that no matter how hard I tried, I'd always be just a shifty fox to them. [Judy's eyes fill with sympathy, her own experiences with prejudice allowing her to empathize deeply with Nick.] Judy Hopps: Nick, I'm so sorry. That must have been terrible. Nick Wilde: [Shrugs, a bitter smile playing on his lips] It taught me a valuable lesson, though. Never show the world who you really are. It's easier to play the role everyone expects from you. Judy Hopps: But that's not who you are, Nick. Not really. You're one of the most caring and loyal friends I've ever had. [Nick looks at Judy, his usual facade softening at her words.] Nick Wilde: [Quietly] You might be one of the only ones to think that, Carrots. After that day, I embraced the stereotype. Became the fox everyone thought I was supposed to be. Con artist, hustler... you name it. It was easier than getting hurt again. Judy Hopps: But look at you now. You're a police officer making a real difference in Zootopia. Nick Wilde: [Locks eyes with Judy, a glimmer of gratitude in his] And I have you to thank for that. You saw past the stereotype and gave me a chance. I guess... I guess you reminded me that I could be more than what the world expects me to be. Judy Hopps: [Smiles warmly] We're more than what others say we are, Nick. We prove that every day. [Nick nods, his usual confident smile returning as he looks at Judy with newfound respect and camaraderie.] Nick Wilde: Thanks, Carrots. For everything. You know, sharing all this... doesn't feel as bad as I thought it would. Judy Hopps: [Grins] That's what friends are for, Nick. To listen, support, and push each other to be our best selves. [Nick chuckles, shaking his head in amusement. Their conversation continues into the evening, a little lighter now, as they delve into plans for their next big case together.] [End scene.]"},{"prompt":"You know I have a mother in law that loves being in charge very controlling and overbearing when she has money and tend to behave bad towards you if she thinks she is offering you a financial value. But she’s illiterate and I help her to do things. Currently got her indefinite leave in the uk and I found out I can help her claim some benefits worth 3400 monthly but she doesn’t want me to do it for her and I am also unhappy she might get more control over my husband if she makes such money every month.","response":"It sounds like you're in a challenging situation that's not just about money, but also about family dynamics, control, and autonomy. Your concerns are understandable, especially given the complex relationship dynamics involved. First, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding. Despite the challenges, remember that your mother-in-law's literacy issues and her controlling behavior could stem from feelings of insecurity or a lack of control in other areas of her life. Financial independence might actually reduce some of her controlling behaviors if she feels more secure. However, the way she uses that financial independence can also be a concern, especially if it exacerbates existing issues. Here are a few steps you could consider taking: 1. **Communicate with Your Partner**: It's crucial that you and your husband are on the same page regarding this situation. Discuss your concerns openly and honestly with him, focusing on how these changes might affect your family dynamics. It's important that both of you present a united front and set boundaries together. 2. **Facilitate Autonomy**: If your mother-in-law is resistant to your help directly, perhaps there's another way you can support her to claim the benefits without it being directly from you. This could involve guiding her to a community center, charity organization, or a professional who can assist her without your direct involvement, thus reducing any perceived control she might have over you through this process. 3. **Set Boundaries**: It's critical to establish healthy boundaries with your mother-in-law, especially regarding her control and influence over your family financial decisions and dynamics. This is something you and your husband need to discuss and agree upon. Once set, these boundaries should be communicated clearly and kindly but firmly to your mother-in-law. 4. **Seek Support**: Handling such a dynamic can be emotionally taxing. Consider seeking support from a counselor or therapist for yourself and potentially as a family. They can provide strategies and tools to manage the relationship in a healthy and constructive manner. 5. **Address Financial Implications Together**: Discuss with your husband the financial implications of her receiving these benefits. Would this money be used for her care and well-being, or is there a risk it might be used manipulatively? These are conversations worth having to anticipate and plan for potential scenarios. Remember, while you can offer support and guidance, adults ultimately make their own decisions. Ensuring you and your partner have a strong, unified approach will help you navigate whatever decision she makes regarding the benefits and any resultant changes in your family dynamics."},{"prompt":"She sleeps in the same room with us but if she gets her housing benefits she will move and be able to stay in a two bedroom apartment. Husband wants us to move in with her which is financially wise as we will be saving a lot of money. While I am only worried about her overbearing issue","response":"Your situation is indeed delicate and requires careful consideration of both the practical and emotional aspects involved. While the financial benefits of moving in together are clear, your concerns about your mother-in-law's overbearing nature are equally valid and important. Here are some strategies and considerations to address this situation: # 1. **Open Dialogue with Your Husband** Start by having an in-depth conversation with your husband about your concerns. It's crucial that he understands how his mother's behavior affects you. Be honest about your feelings and the potential impact on your relationship and personal well-being. Highlight that while the financial savings are significant, so is the health of your marriage and your mental health. # 2. **Establish Boundaries** Before any decisions are made about moving, discuss what boundaries can be put in place to ensure everyone's comfort and autonomy. Consider: - Private spaces that are off-limits to others unless invited - Agreeing on mutual respect for everyone's independence and decision-making - Setting specific \\"quiet times\\" or \\"alone times\\" for everyone to have space # 3. **Negotiate a Trial Period** If possible, suggest a trial period for living together. This can be a couple of months during which everyone can evaluate how the arrangement is working. This period should have clear 'check-in' points where everyone can express their feelings and concerns openly. # 4. **Financial Planning** Discuss how the financial benefits of living together can be maximized for the future. Perhaps you can agree on a savings plan for the money you'll be saving on rent and bills. Setting concrete financial goals can help make the arrangement feel like a shared project, with benefits for everyone involved. # 5. **Seek External Support** Consider involving a neutral third party, such as a therapist or counselor, to help navigate this transition. They can provide an outside perspective and mediate discussions on boundaries, living arrangements, and handling conflicts. # 6. **Plan for Independence** Make a long-term plan for eventually living independently again. Knowing there's a plan in place for your own space in the future can make the current situation more bearable and give you something to work towards. # 7. **Engage in Activities Outside the Home** To maintain your sense of independence and personal space, pursue interests or activities outside the home. This can also apply to your mother-in-law, as encouraging her to have her own social life and interests can help alleviate some of the overbearing behavior. # 8. **Foster a Positive Relationship** Look for ways to improve your relationship with your mother-in-law. Finding common ground, shared interests, or engaging in activities together can sometimes ease tensions and build mutual respect. # Decision Time Ultimately, you and your husband need to weigh the financial savings against the potential strain on your marital and personal well-being. Remind yourselves that financial savings, while important, aren't always worth the cost to your happiness and mental health. Your decision should be a mutual one that considers the needs and well-being of all involved."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Starting with ( f(x) = frac{sqrt{x+1}-1}{x} ), let's use the conjugate of the numerator to simplify the expression. The conjugate of (sqrt{x+1}-1) is (sqrt{x+1}+1). We multiply both the numerator and the denominator by this conjugate to get rid of the square root in the numerator. [ f(x) = frac{sqrt{x+1}-1}{x} times frac{sqrt{x+1}+1}{sqrt{x+1}+1} ] [ = frac{(sqrt{x+1}-1)(sqrt{x+1}+1)}{x(sqrt{x+1}+1)} ] [ = frac{(x+1)-1^2}{x(sqrt{x+1}+1)} ] [ = frac{x}{x(sqrt{x+1}+1)} ] [ = frac{1}{sqrt{x+1}+1} ] Now, we can directly evaluate the limit as ( x ) approaches 0: [ lim_{x to 0} frac{1}{sqrt{x+1}+1} ] Substitute ( x = 0 ): [ = frac{1}{sqrt{0+1}+1} ] [ = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, the limit of ( f(x) = frac{sqrt{x+1}-1}{x} ) as ( x ) approaches 0 is ( frac{1}{2} )."},{"prompt":"Find the points on the graph y=2(x-29)(x+1）of where the tangent line is horizontal.","response":"To find the points on the graph of (y=2(x-29)(x+1)) where the tangent line is horizontal, we first need to find the derivative of the function because the slope of the tangent line at any point is given by the derivative at that point. A horizontal tangent line has a slope of 0, so we set the derivative equal to 0 and solve for (x). Given the function: [y=2(x-29)(x+1)] First, let's expand the function: [y=2(x^2 - 29x + x - 29)] [y=2(x^2 - 28x - 29)] [y=2x^2 - 56x - 58] Now, find the derivative of (y) with respect to (x): [y'=4x - 56] Setting the derivative equal to 0 to find where the slope of the tangent is horizontal: [4x - 56 = 0] Solve for (x): [4x = 56] [x = 14] Next, to find the corresponding (y) value when (x=14), plug (x=14) back into the original function: [y=2(14-29)(14+1)] [y=2(-15)(15)] [y=2(-225)] [y=-450] Therefore, the point on the graph where the tangent line is horizontal is ((14, -450))."},{"prompt":"Find the points on the graph y=(x with square 2+2x+1)(x with square 2+2x+1) of where the tangent line is horizontal.","response":"To find the points on the graph of (y=(x^2+2x+1)^2) where the tangent line is horizontal, we need to determine where the derivative of the function is equal to 0, as horizontal tangent lines have a slope of 0.

If (y = u^2) where (u = (x+1)^2), then by the chain rule, we have: [ y' = 2u times frac{du}{dx} ] Now, differentiate (u = (x+1)^2): [ frac{du}{dx} = 2(x+1) ] Therefore, the derivative of (y) with respect to (x) is: [ y' = 2(x+1)^2 times 2(x+1) ] [ y' = 4(x+1)^3 ] To find where the tangent line is horizontal, set (y') equal to 0: [ 4(x+1)^3 = 0 ] This equation is solved by finding the (x) value that makes ((x+1)^3 = 0): [ (x+1)^3 = 0 ] [ x+1 = 0 ] [ x = -1 ] Therefore, when (x = -1), the derivative is 0, indicating a horizontal tangent line. To find the corresponding (y) value when (x = -1): [ y = ((-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1)^2 ] [ y = (1 - 2 + 1)^2 ] [ y = 0^2 ] [ y = 0 ] Thus, the point on the graph where the tangent line is horizontal is ((-1, 0))."},{"prompt":"Differentiate, but do not simplify the function y=(x+1 with square 3(x+4)(x-3)with square 3.","response":"To differentiate the given function (y = (x+1)^3(x+4)(x-3)^3) without simplifying, we'll apply the product rule, which in the case of three functions, can be extended as follows: If (f(x) = u cdot v cdot w), then the derivative (f'(x)) is: [f'(x) = u'vw + uv'w + uvw'] Here, we identify (u = (x+1)^3), (v = (x+4)), and (w = (x-3)^3).

Let's find their derivatives ((u', v', w')): 1. For (u = (x+1)^3), the derivative is: [ u' = 3(x+1)^2 ] 2. For (v = (x+4)), the derivative is simply 1, because the derivative of (x) is (1), and the constant 4 disappears: [ v' = 1 ] 3. For (w = (x-3)^2), applying the power rule gives: [ w' = 2(x-3)^1 cdot 1 = 2(x-3) ] With these derivatives, we can now construct our differentiated function using the extended product rule: [y'(x) = u'vw + uv'w + uvw'] Substituting (u, v, w, u', v', ) and ( w' ) gives: [y'(x) = 3(x+1)^2(x+4)(x-3)^2 + (x+1)^3(1)(x-3)^2 + (x+1)^3(x+4)2(x-3)] Although one normally might simplify at this stage, since the instruction was not to, we leave the differentiated function of (y = (x+1)^3(x+4)(x-3)^2) as: [y'(x) = 3(x+1)^2(x+4)(x-3)^2 + (x+1)^3(x-3)^2 + 2(x+1)^3(x+4)(x-3)]"},{"prompt":"Differentiate, but do not simplify the function y=(x with square 2)((3x with square 2+4)with square 2)((3-xwith square 3)with square 4).","response":"To differentiate the given function [ y = x^2 cdot (3x^2 + 4)^2 cdot (3-x^3)^4, ] using the product rule for multiple functions, where the derivative of a product of three functions (uvw) is given by [ (uvw)' = u'vw + uv'w + uvw', ] we identify each function as: - ( u = x^2 ), - ( v = (3x^2 + 4)^2 ), - ( w = (3-x^3)^4 ).

As you move down the height of the cone from the apex, the radius of the cone increases linearly until it reaches (R) at the base (height (H)). The relationship between the radius of the cone at any given height ((y), measured from the apex downwards) and the height can be determined by the similar triangles principle. Specifically, the ratio of the radius of the cone at any height to the total radius (R) is equal to the ratio of the distance from the apex to the height of the cylinder (H-h), to the total height (H). So, [frac{r}{R} = frac{H - h}{H}] Since (R = 4) and (H = 8), we can substitute these values to find a relation for (r) in terms of (h): [r = 4left(frac{8 - h}{8}right) = frac{8 - h}{2}] The volume (V) of the cylinder is determined by its radius (r) and height (h): [V = pi r^2 h] Substituting (r) in terms of (h): [V = pi left(frac{8 - h}{2}right)^2 h = pi left(frac{64 - 16h + h^2}{4}right) h = pileft(16 - 4h + frac{1}{4}h^2right) h] [V = pi left(16h - 4h^2 + frac{1}{4}h^3right)] To maximize the volume, we take the derivative of the volume with respect to (h) and set it to zero: [V' = pi (16 - 8h + frac{3}{4}h^2) = 0] Simplifying this quadratic equation to solve for (h) gives: [16 - 8h + frac{3}{4}h^2 = 0] [frac{3}{4}h^2 - 8h + 16 = 0] Multiplying by (4) to clear the denominator: [3h^2 - 32h + 64 = 0] Using the quadratic formula, where (a = 3), (b = -32), and (c = 64): [h = frac{-(-32) pm sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4(3)(64)}}{2(3)}] [h = frac{32 pm sqrt{1024 - 768}}{6}] [h = frac{32 pm sqrt{256}}{6}] [h = frac{32 pm 16}{6}] We take the positive solution for a meaningful physical dimension: [h = frac{32 + 16}{6} = frac{48}{6} = 8] However, there seems to be a miscalculation in the simplification step of the solution to the quadratic equation - let me correct that.

Mu calculation is Radius (r= frac{8}{3} , m) . Please re-do.","response":"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's correctly determine the dimensions of the largest right cylinder that can be inscribed in a cone with given dimensions. Given a cone with radius (R = 4,m) and height (H = 8,m), we want to find the dimensions of the largest inscribed right cylinder. # 1. Geometric Setup The cylinder is inscribed in the cone, so its radius (r) and height (h) vary directly as it moves from the apex to the base. Using similar triangles (from the cone's side view), we can relate the cylinder's dimensions to the cone's dimensions. # 2. Relationship via Similar Triangles For the inscribed cylinder at a given height (h), we can observe that the portion above the cylinder within the cone forms similar triangles, leading to: [ frac{r}{h} = frac{R}{H} ] Since ( R = 4,m ) and ( H = 8,m ), we substitute these values: [ frac{r}{h} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} ] [ r = frac{1}{2}h ] # 3. Cylinder Volume The volume of a cylinder (V) is defined as (V = pi r^2 h). Substituting ( r = frac{1}{2}h ) into the volume formula: [ V = pi left(frac{1}{2}hright)^2 h = pi frac{1}{4}h^3 ] # 4. Maximizing the Volume To maximize volume, we differentiate ( V ) with respect to ( h ) and set the derivative to 0. [ frac{dV}{dh} = pi frac{3}{4}h^2 = 0 ] Since ( h^2 ) cannot be 0 for a physical cylinder, we recognize that this derivative does not provide a zero point when solving for (h). But we maximize the volume when the cylinder's dimensions maximally utilize the cone's dimensions – thus, we analyze the height (h) in conjunction to the cone's given constraints. # Correcting Steps My previous explanation mistakenly calculated specific steps for identifying (h) via differentiation in the wrong context. Given (r = frac{1}{2}h) and needing the largest cylinder, we should consider the full use of the cone's dimensions directly without incorrectly applying a maximization step previously described. Instead, knowing that we are confined by the cone's dimensions with ( R = 4,m ) and ( H = 8,m ), and the relationship ( r = frac{1}{2}h ), we look at the feasible maximum (h) within these restrictions directly. # Utilizing the Cone's Full Dimensions Cylinders inscribed in cones reach maximal dimensions when closest to the base, given the cone's tapering shape. Correctly, I should have noted the geometric relations and restrictions clearly direct us toward maximally utilizing the inscribed space considering the biggest possible (r) and (h) that fulfill the given geometric relation. # Corrected Insight (Given Misinterpretation) The objective is to maximize the volume subject to (xy = 100) and (S = x + 2y) as minimized for a different problem. Given we maximized the cylinder within a cone, let's address the appropriate maximization reflecting (r = frac{1}{2}h), implying we directly seek the maximum volume (V) or equivalently, the maximal (r) and (h), based on the cone’s dimensions, without leading to a misinterpretation. The correction was to focus precisely on the relationship (r = frac{1}{2}h) with the cone's constraints, which led to confusion. Inscribe maximally, implies recognizing the cylinder's (r) maximizes within the given (R) and (H), without misapplying differentiation steps meant for direct volume maximization, my error led to a detailed misinterpretation. Reflecting back directly: To correctly find the largest cylinder dimensions within these parameters, techniques using the cone's dimensions as boundary conditions are directly analyzed, not through unnecessary maximization steps, but understanding geometric relations and boundaries directly provided. My elaboration mistakenly led into incorrect differentiation application for this scenario. Your solution suggests looking into the maximal dimensions up to the full utilization of the cone's base and height for the largest possible cylinder, where direct geometric relations, specifically similar triangles, indicate how (h) and (r) proportionally increase to their maximal (R) and (H), reviewing the cone and cylinder inscribed scenario directly.

Es aquella que suscribe el cliente con la Empresa por la máxima carga admisible de la conexión asignada al suministro. El cliente deberá abstenerse de tomar una carga mayor a la contratada pues de lo contrario estaría sujeto a la suspensión del suministro por poner en peligro las instalaciones de la Empresa.","response":"La Potencia Contratada es un término utilizado en el sector eléctrico para referirse al máximo nivel de potencia eléctrica que un cliente o usuario acuerda con la empresa suministradora que puede demandar de la red en un punto de suministro específico. Esta potencia es acordada y establecida en el contrato de suministro eléctrico y es un parámetro crucial para determinar la tarifa que el cliente deberá pagar. La importancia de seleccionar adecuadamente la potencia contratada radica en el equilibrio entre asegurar que la instalación disponga de suficiente potencia para su correcto funcionamiento, y el evitar pagar por una potencia excesivamente alta que no se va a utilizar. Si un usuario supera la potencia contratada, el suministro eléctrico puede interrumpirse automáticamente mediante un dispositivo de control (ICP o su equivalente en sistemas más modernos) para proteger la red y las instalaciones. Además, superar la potencia contratada regularmente puede conllevar penalizaciones o la necesidad de contratar una potencia superior, lo cual incrementaría el costo de la factura eléctrica. Los usuarios pueden solicitar cambios en la potencia contratada si sus necesidades de consumo cambian, sujeto a las políticas y posibles costos administrativos de la empresa suministradora. Este ajuste permite optimizar el coste de la factura eléctrica, adaptándola a las necesidades reales de consumo del cliente. En resumen, la potencia contratada es una figura esencial en la relación contractual entre el usuario y la empresa eléctrica, determinante para la capacidad de consumo del usuario y el costo de su servicio eléctrico."},{"prompt":"explicalo mas sencillo por favor, y pon ejemplos, tipo un refrigerador o un taladro","response":"Claro, vamos a simplificarlo: Imagina que la electricidad es como el agua en una tubería. La \\"Potencia Contratada\\" es como el tamaño de esa tubería. Si tienes una tubería grande (una potencia contratada alta), puedes dejar pasar mucha agua (electricidad) a la vez, lo que te permite usar muchos aparatos al mismo tiempo. Pero si tu tubería es pequeña (potencia contratada baja), solo puedes dejar pasar un poco de agua (electricidad), y si intentas usar muchos aparatos a la vez, la tubería no da abasto. **Ejemplo con un refrigerador:** Supongamos que tu refrigerador necesita una pequeña cantidad de agua (electricidad) para funcionar. En este caso, incluso una tubería pequeña (una potencia contratada baja) sería suficiente para mantener tu refrigerador funcionando sin problemas. **Ejemplo con un taladro:** Ahora, imaginemos que decides usar un taladro, el cual necesita mucha más agua (electricidad) para funcionar que el refrigerador. Si tienes una tubería pequeña (potencia contratada baja) y estás usando el refrigerador al mismo tiempo, puede que no haya suficiente agua (electricidad) para ambos. Como resultado, la presión del agua (la potencia) podría ser insuficiente y, en el mundo de la electricidad, esto podría hacer que los interruptores saltaran y cortaran el suministro eléctrico para proteger tu instalación. **¿Qué sucede si uso demasiados aparatos a la vez?** Siguiendo con la analogía, si intentas hacer pasar más agua (electricidad) de la que tu tubería (potencia contratada) puede manejar, es como si estuvieras tratando de forzar más agua a través de la tubería de lo que puede soportar. Esto puede causar que tu sistema eléctrico \\"se ahogue\\" y corte el suministro para evitar daños. **Consejo:** Si sabes que solo vas a usar aparatos que requieren poca agua (electricidad), como luces y el refrigerador, una tubería pequeña (potencia contratada baja) es suficiente. Pero si planeas usar aparatos que necesitan mucha agua (electricidad), como taladros eléctricos, secadoras de cabello potentes, o muchos aparatos a la vez, quizás necesites una tubería más grande (una potencia contratada mayor). **En resumen**, la Potencia Contratada es como elegir el tamaño de una tubería para tu casa, basándote en cuánta agua (electricidad) planeas usar. Si eliges una tubería muy pequeña, podrías no tener suficiente agua para todas tus necesidades. Si eliges una muy grande, estarás pagando por una capacidad que no necesitas."},{"prompt":"check grammar:anemia is the problem of reduction of oxygen in red blood cells, specifically, the reduction of hemoglobin. cause of anemia: 1, excessive loss of blood ,for example, chronic GI blood loss can result in iron-deficiency anemia. 2,destruction of red blood cells, for example, hemolysis. 3,bone marrow can't produce enough RBCs. blood test can detect anemia, the normal range in terms of the level of hemoglobin : less than 14g/100 ml for men, less than 12g/100ml for women. iron, vitamin B12 and folate are associated with anemia. patients with anemia may have symptoms like shortness of breath, weakness, tiredness, easily bruising. so during physical therapy, they can't undergo intensive, or long period of time of excercise.","response":"Anemia is the problem of a reduction of oxygen in red blood cells, specifically, the reduction of hemoglobin.

Undermethylation, sometimes described in the context of mental health and wellness discussions, can refer to a condition where there is a reduced ability to add methyl groups to certain compounds, which is significant for numerous biological processes including DNA, RNA, proteins, and neurotransmitter synthesis and regulation. It's been discussed in various health circles, often in the context of mood disorders, behavioral issues, and other health concerns. However, it's essential to proceed with a comprehensive and evidence-based approach: # 1. Professional Diagnosis - **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: The first step should be to consult with a healthcare provider, such as a doctor who specializes in biochemistry, genetics, or psychiatry who understands methylation processes. A medical professional can offer testing to confirm any suspected methylation issues and determine their extent. # 2. Nutritional Support - **Diet Adjustments**: Diet plays a crucial role in supporting methylation processes. Foods rich in methionine like eggs, Brazil nuts, fish, and meats are often recommended. Additionally, foods that provide B vitamins, particularly folate, B6, and B12, can support methylation. - **Supplementation**: Under the guidance of a healthcare provider, certain supplements might be beneficial, including SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine), methylfolate (a bioavailable form of folate), methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12), and others tailored to the individual's needs. However, supplementation should be approached cautiously, as improper use can exacerbate issues. # 3. Lifestyle Modifications - **Stress Reduction**: High-stress levels can negatively impact overall health, including methylation processes. Incorporating stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness, meditation, and regular physical exercise can be beneficial. - **Sleep Hygiene**: Good quality sleep supports numerous biochemical processes, including methylation. Adopting a healthy sleep schedule and practicing good sleep hygiene can help. - **Avoiding Excess Alcohol and Smoking**: Both smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can impact methylation, so reducing or eliminating these can be beneficial. # 4. Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustment - **Follow-up Testing**: Methylation and its effects on health can change over time, so regular follow-up with a healthcare provider is important to adjust any treatment or dietary plan as needed. # 5. Educational Empowerment - **Stay Informed**: New research is continually emerging on methylation and its impact on health. Staying informed through reliable sources can empower you to make knowledgeable decisions about your health. # Note of Caution It’s essential to approach any treatment plan for undermethylation (or any health condition) under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider. Self-diagnosis and treatment without professional input can lead to unintended consequences. Each individual's health situation is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another."},{"prompt":"Give Sudarsky class for gas giant with clouds of sulfuric/phosphoric acid, color is #fff8d4","response":"The Sudarsky's classification system for gas giants categorizes planets based on their appearance and atmospheric conditions. This system, primarily theoretical, divides gas giant planets into different types based on their temperature, composition, and resultant atmospheric features. Given your description of a gas giant with clouds of sulfuric or phosphoric acid and a color of #fff8d4 (a pale, light yellow similar to cream), we can attempt to place it within the Sudarsky classification. The color and described atmospheric composition suggest a planet with a relatively cooler temperature where more complex molecules can condense into visible clouds. The Sudarsky system originally includes the following classes: 1. **Class I: Ammonia Clouds** - These are the coldest type of gas giants where ammonia clouds are dominant. These planets would likely have a more whitish appearance due to the high reflectivity of ammonia clouds. 2. **Class II: Water Clouds** - Slightly warmer than Class I, these planets have temperatures that allow for water vapor to condense into clouds, which might give them a bluish hue. 3. **Class III: Cloudless** - These are hot planets where silicates and iron could be found in their gaseous form. The lack of clouds can lead to a darker, more non-reflective appearance as these planets absorb more light. 4. **Class IV: Alkali Metals** - In these very hot planets, the presence of alkali metals in the atmosphere gives them a distinct orange or red-brown hue due to the scattering of blue and green light. 5. **Class V: Silicate Clouds** - The hottest types of gas giants, with temperatures allowing for the formation of silicate clouds. They might appear with a silicate haze, possibly giving them a blueish color due to scattering. Given the absence of a direct category in Sudarsky's system for gas giants with sulfuric or phosphoric acid clouds, and based on your color description which suggests a relatively cooler temperature allowing for the formation of complex molecules such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid, the planet might fit into a speculative subclass between Class I and Class II. It would be in a temperature range that allows for the condensation of sulfuric or phosphoric acid, but since Sudarsky's original classification does not explicitly account for such compositions, it's a bit of an extrapolation. The cream-like color (#fff8d4) suggests a light-reflecting upper cloud layer, possibly indicating a composition or cloud structure different from typical ammonia or water clouds but still within a cooler temperature regime. Such a planet might suggest expansion or refinement of the existing Sudarsky classes to accommodate a wider variety of atmospheric compositions and reflectivities not initially covered in the basic five-class system. Therefore, while it doesn't fit neatly into Sudarky's existing classes, it points to the need for a nuanced understanding of gas giant atmospheres beyond the original classification."},{"prompt":"Chromochemical (color-chemistry) classification system of gas giant: 1.

This category is characterized by the presence of sulfuric acid clouds, which matches the atmospheric composition you described. The color code you've associated with the Acidian class, #fff8d4, aligns well with the pale, cream-like color indicative of such atmospheric conditions. The \\"Acidian\\" classification suggests a planet where the atmospheric temperature and pressure conditions allow sulfuric acid to condense into clouds. This is quite interesting as it implies a chemical environment that, while hostile to life as we know it, presents a fascinating study for astrochemistry and exoplanetary science. In terms of its placement within the broader context of gas giant classifications, the Acidian class adds a layer of detail by focusing on the specific chemical makeup of the planet's atmosphere rather than just the physical conditions or the dominant components of the atmosphere, as seen in Sudarsky's classification system. The Acidian class provides a more nuanced understanding of the planet's appearance, atmospheric chemistry, and potentially its formation conditions and evolutionary history. This detailed chromochemical classification system reflects a significant advance in how we might categorize exoplanets, especially with the future of exoplanet observation looking towards more detailed atmospheric characterization through next-generation telescopes and space missions. Understanding the specific chemistry behind the colors of these gas giants could greatly enhance our knowledge of their atmospheres, weather patterns, and overall planetary dynamics."},{"prompt":"Describe Frigidian gas giant","response":"A Frigidian gas giant, as per the chromochemical classification system you described, is characterized by its hydrogen clouds and a notable lack of complex chemistry in its atmosphere. The color associated with this class is #f5f6ff, a very pale blue, almost white, suggesting a cold and relatively simple atmospheric composition dominated by hydrogen. # Atmospheric Composition The dominant presence of hydrogen clouds in a Frigidian gas giant indicates an atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen, which is the most abundant element in the universe. The lack of complex chemistry suggests that the temperatures within the planet's atmosphere are possibly too cold for more complex chemical reactions to occur, or the pressure conditions do not favor the formation of heavier or more complex molecules beyond diatomic hydrogen (H₂) and minor traces of helium (He). # Appearance The color code #f5f6ff would give the planet a nearly pure but very pale blue-white appearance, reflecting the minimal absorption of sunlight and the scattering of the shorter (blue) wavelengths of light by the hydrogen atmosphere. This coloration and the presence of hydrogen clouds might give the planet a smooth, almost featureless appearance from a distance, with subtle variations in brightness and hue possibly indicating cloud depth or minor compositional variations. # Temperature and Orbital Characteristics Given the description as a \\"Frigidian\\" gas giant, we can infer that the planet is in a colder region of its star system or has an atmospheric temperature profile that does not facilitate the warm-temperature chemistry seen in other gas giant classes. Such planets might orbit far from their host star, in the outer regions of the star system, where solar insolation is much weaker. # Potential Scientific Interest Despite its seemingly simple chemical composition, a Frigidian gas giant could be of significant scientific interest for several reasons: - **Study of Primordial Conditions**: Its atmosphere could represent conditions similar to the early stages of the solar system, offering insights into planetary formation and the evolution of gas giants. - **Hydrogen Dynamics**: Understanding the dynamics of hydrogen clouds and their interactions with cosmic rays or the interstellar medium could provide valuable physics insights. - **Search for Helium Rain**: In certain conditions, it's theorized that gas giants can have \\"helium rain,\\" a phenomenon that could potentially occur in such a cold, hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. In summary, a Frigidian gas giant represents a class of exoplanets with cold, hydrogen-rich atmospheres, providing a fascinating subject for the study of planetary atmospheres, the conditions of early planetary systems, and the fundamental physics of gas giants."},{"prompt":"Describe Lilacean gas giant","response":"A Lilacean gas giant, based on the chromochemical classification system you've provided, is characterized by clouds formed from nitrogen and carbon monoxide, marked with a distinctive color code of #fef5ff, suggesting a very pale lilac or lavender appearance. This specific combination of atmospheric gasses and resultant coloration hints at a unique and intriguing type of gas giant planet. # Atmospheric Composition The presence of nitrogen (N₂) and carbon monoxide (CO) as dominant constituents in the atmosphere forms the basis of this classification. Nitrogen, a relatively inert gas, suggests a stabilizing component that does not easily engage in complex chemical reactions under most conditions found in planetary atmospheres. Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, is a more reactive molecule that can participate in various chemical processes and is indicative of a reducing atmosphere where oxygen is scarce relative to carbon. # Appearance With a pale lavender color (#fef5ff), a Lilacean gas giant would present a subtle but distinctly colored appearance when observed. The pale lilac hue implies a rather diffuse scattering of sunlight through its upper atmospheric layers, with the specific atmospheric chemistry involving nitrogen and carbon monoxide influencing the way light is absorbed and reflected. # Temperature and Orbital Characteristics The formation of nitrogen and carbon monoxide clouds suggests a specific temperature range that allows these gasses to condense but doesn’t facilitate the formation of more complex or heavier compounds. The exact temperature range would depend on the atmospheric pressure but is indicative of conditions that are neither extremely hot nor extremely cold on the spectrum of gas giant temperatures. Given this, a Lilacean gas giant might be found in a wide range of orbital positions, potentially closer to its star where temperatures are moderate enough to prevent freezing out of these gasses yet cool enough to avoid their dissociation. # Potential Scientific Interest Lilacean gas giants could provide fascinating insights into planetary atmospheric dynamics and chemistry: - **Atmospheric Processes**: Studying the formation and behavior of nitrogen and carbon monoxide clouds can offer clues about atmospheric circulation, thermal regulation, and weather patterns on similar gas giant planets. - **Comparative Planetology**: Observing and understanding the conditions on a Lilacean gas giant allows scientists to compare and contrast with the atmospheres of other types of planets, enhancing our understanding of planetary systems. - **Astrobiology**: While not directly related to life as we know it, understanding the atmospheric chemistry of planets like these can inform the models of planetary habitability and the potential for sustaining known biological processes. In essence, a Lilacean gas giant, with its unique atmospheric composition and distinct coloration, represents an intriguing class of exoplanets. Such planets might provide invaluable insights into planetary formation, the behavior of nitrogen and carbon monoxide in extraterrestrial environments, and the diversity of atmospheric conditions that exist across the universe."},{"prompt":"Describe Methanian gas giant","response":"A Methanian gas giant, as classified in your provided chromochemical system, is distinguished by its methane-rich atmospheric composition, manifesting clouds primarily composed of methane (CH₄). This distinct composition imbues the planet with a characteristic color, #c4eeff, which denotes a pale, icy blue tinge reminiscent of Neptune or Uranus in our solar system. # Atmospheric Composition Methane, a simple hydrocarbon, plays a critical role in the atmospheric chemistry and appearance of Methanian gas giants. In these planets, the upper atmosphere contains substantial concentrations of methane, which interacts with incoming sunlight.

This classification points to active sulfur chemistry and potentially volcanic processes. 5. **Ammonian**: Characterized by ammonia clouds, possibly with hazes of tholin and phosphorus, leading to varied appearances from pale off-white to deeper shades of orange (#fff1e0, #ffdca1, #d99559). This classification is reminiscent of conditions seen in Jupiter and Saturn's upper atmospheres. 6. **Waterian**: Dominated by water clouds and appearing pure white (#ffffff), suggesting a temperature range that allows water vapor to condense into vast, reflective cloud decks. 7. **Acidian**: Featuring clouds of sulfuric acid, these planets have a pale, creamy yellow appearance (#fff8d4), indicative of a chemically reactive atmosphere with conditions allowing for sulfuric acid formation. 8. **Navyean**: Described as having cloudless and opaque hazes, resulting in a deep navy blue color (#175973). This suggests an atmosphere with clear deep layers overlain by thick, high-altitude hazes. 9. **Siliconelian**: Identified by siloxane hazes, these planets appear in muted, grayish-brown tones (#998c7e), pointing to silicon and oxygen chemistry at play within the atmosphere. 10. **Alkalian**: With alkali metal hazes, they exhibit dark, dusky appearances (#271f1d), indicating high temperatures that vaporize metals like sodium and potassium into the atmosphere. 11. **Silicatian**: Featuring clouds of silica and magnesium/iron silicate, presenting in shades of muted green-gray and steel blue-gray (#7e8c77 and #788a8d), suggestive of an atmosphere rich in silicate particles. 12. **Rutilian**: Characterized by refractory metal oxide hazes, these planets almost absorb all incoming light, appearing in very dark tones almost black (#2b0e04). 13. **Corundian**: Hosting clouds of corundum, calcium oxide, and perovskite, and displaying vibrant reds, oranges, and pinks (#d93030, #f59f16, #e62582), indicating a high-temperature environment for refractory compounds. 14. **Fuliginian**: Dominated by refractory metal carbides and carbon hazes, resulting in a planet that appears nearly black (#040305, #050403, #030303) due to the dense, light-absorbing particles in the atmosphere. This system highlights the potential variety of gas giant planets that could exist, emphasizing atmospheric chemistry and appearance. It's a speculative yet insightful approach to understanding and classifying the multitude of exoplanets discovered and yet to be discovered, by considering their physical appearance as a window into their atmospheric properties and chemical dynamics."},{"prompt":"Let's play a game together.

Assistant Mayor Bellwether is behind its creation and uses it to instigate fear among the populace of Zootopia, framing predators and aiming to elevate her status and power. Doug, a ram, is heavily involved in its manufacturing and distribution, operating from a hidden laboratory in the subway tunnels of Zootopia. You really did an amazing job answering these questions, showing a wide-ranging knowledge of the film, from its characters to its more nuanced plot details. Your error in question 6 was a minor slip, and your response to question 9 was understandably challenging without a specific recall of that number. Your answer to question 10 showcased a good understanding of the film’s central conspiracy, even though a bit more specificity could be added regarding the process and key players.

The clear skies taunted an unreached clarity and striking distance away from any hope of seeing in the dark. Liam traced Victor’s outline as he stumbled across the shoreline, gathering driftwood. “Least I can do is get a bonfire started , despite the horrible pain in my right shoulder “. As he shifted in the sand , his calves elevated on a sand dune, Liam kept his head low. “Don’t strain yourself Vic, we have all night and with me being indisposed and Ryan being ..well”. His eyes , refocusing on Ryan’s unconscious face under the moonlight, he laughed. “Yeah, Ryan is dead to world , after sawin’ through your binds it seems he’s spent.” Victor yelled out from the breakers that lapsed around his ankles . “He’s a hell of a lot more together than me-“","response":"Victor paused, a chuckle escaping his lips despite the throbbing ache that pulsed in sync with his heartbeat in his shoulder. \\"He managed to stay sober enough to get us out of that mess,\\" he called over, the pieces of driftwood in his arms a testament to his determination despite the pain. Liam managed a weak smile, the irony of the situation not lost on him. Here they were, stranded on what seemed like a deserted shoreline, with their fate momentarily resting in the hands of the least likely of them - Ryan, who at this moment was as good as unconscious, the efforts of their escape clearly having taken its toll on him. \\"Let's just hope he recovers fast. We're not exactly in a position to send out SOS signals with flares and smoke,\\" Liam replied, his gaze shifting towards the sky, pondering their next move. The once clear stars now seemed to blur as his thoughts overshadowed the natural beauty. Victor, making his way back, dropped the driftwood with a thud, the sound echoing slightly in the quiet night. He collapsed next to Liam, conserving his strength. \\"We need to keep warm, and maybe signal for help in the morning. For now, let's just survive the night.\\" The two shared a look, an unspoken agreement passing between them. They were in this together, each of them dealing with their own physical or emotional injuries, but united by the sheer will to survive. The night was long, the challenges ahead uncertain, but in that moment, under the blanket of stars, they found a renewed strength in their camaraderie. As the fire crackled to life, painting their faces with its warm glow, Liam and Victor settled in, keeping an eye on Ryan, who still hadn't stirred. The night enveloped them, a silent witness to their plight, the fire their only beacon of hope in the overwhelming darkness. They needed to rest, recover, and plan. For now, though, they had each other, and in the face of their dire situation, that was a small yet significant comfort."},{"prompt":"Just comment on my passage","response":"Your passage beautifully captures a moment of quiet resilience in the face of adversity, weaving together the individual and collective trials of Liam, Victor, and Ryan. The vivid imagery you employ, from the \\"stars with reddened eyes\\" to the \\"moonlight\\" illuminating Ryan's unconscious form, sets a poignant scene that is both atmospheric and charged with emotion. The environment—the deserted shoreline and the clear skies—serves not just as a backdrop but as a character in its own right, reflecting and amplifying the isolation, vulnerability, and yet the flickering hope of the characters. The dialogue between Liam and Victor is natural and reveals a lot about their situation and their personalities without needing to state outright what has happened to them or what they're up against. It hints at a shared ordeal that has left them physically injured and emotionally drained, yet their camaraderie provides a glimmer of hope in the darkness. The reference to Ryan, even in his incapacitated state, introduces another layer to their relationship dynamics and highlights the themes of dependence and trust among them. Your use of humor, despite the seemingly dire circumstances, adds a layer of realism and relatability to your characters. It shows their humanity, their attempt to keep spirits high in the face of uncertainty, and their ability to appreciate the irony of their situation. Finally, the way you end the passage, with Victor collapsing and the two of them making do with their current situation, encapsulates the theme of survival against the odds. Their determination to “just survive the night” is a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit. Overall, your passage is engaging, emotionally resonant, and leaves the reader wanting to know more about the characters and their fate. It strikes a balance between despair and hope, between individual suffering and collective strength, making it a compelling read."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The Big Five, also known as the Five Factor Model, consists of five broad dimension of personality, which are: 1. **Openness to Experience** (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious) 2. **Conscientiousness** (efficient/organized vs. easy-going/careless) 3. **Extraversion** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved) 4. **Agreeableness** (friendly/compassionate vs. analytical/detached) 5. **Neuroticism** (sensitive/nervous vs. secure/confident) The acronym you mentioned, \\"SCOAI,\\" doesn't directly correspond to the initials of these five traits. It's possible that you might be referring to a specific model, sub-domain, or perhaps a psychological assessment tool that is not universally recognized or that has been developed after my last update. Alternatively, it could represent a specific interpretation or a localized adaptation of the Big Five or another psychological model that isn't widely known in the broader psychological community. If \\"SCOAI\\" is meant to be a specific characteristic summary or type within a personality model, it would helpful to know the context or the source from which it arises. Without more specific information, addressing its implications or how it integrates with the Big Five personality traits is challenging."},{"prompt":"If the universe stopped expanding, would time change?","response":"The expansion of the universe is a key concept in modern cosmology, deeply connected to the general theory of relativity, which describes how matter and energy influence the geometry of space-time. The expansion is observed through the redshift of light from distant galaxies, indicating that the fabric of the universe itself is stretching, causing galaxies to move away from each other. However, the question of whether time would change if the universe stopped expanding is somewhat more nuanced and depends on how we interpret \\"time\\" in this context. 1. **Cosmic Time and Expansion**: The expansion of the universe is described by the scale factor, a function that grows with time in our current understanding of the universe. \\"Cosmic time\\" refers to a time coordinate chosen so that the universe has the same age everywhere when described with this time coordinate. If the expansion were to suddenly stop, it would represent a dramatic change in the behavior of the scale factor—a transition to a constant value. Cosmic time would continue to progress, but the scale factor's change with respect to cosmic time would halt. 2. **Local Perception of Time**: On a local scale (e.g., within our galaxy, solar system, or on Earth), the direct impact of the universe's expansion is negligible due to gravitational binding forces which ensure that these structures do not expand along with the universe. Consequently, the cessation of the universe's expansion would not directly affect our local perception of time or the operation of physical processes at these scales. 3. **General Relativity and Time Dilation**: General relativity describes how the presence of mass and energy can warp the fabric of space and time. Massive objects like stars and planets curve space-time, producing the phenomena we perceive as gravity. Time passes differently in regions of differing gravitational potential—affect known as gravitational time dilation. If the universe stopped expanding, any direct effect on time from a general relativity standpoint would likely be more relevant on cosmological scales. The overall distribution of matter and energy on large scales would be impacted, but this would not directly alter the fundamental flow of time as experienced locally, away from extreme conditions like black holes where gravitational time dilation effects are pronounced. 4. **Hypothetical Scenarios and Physics Beyond Our Current Understanding**: It's essential to note that the hypothetical scenario where the universe's expansion stops abruptly is not supported by current models of cosmology, which predict either continued expansion or scenarios that do not involve a sudden halt. If such an event were theoretically possible, its full implications on the fabric of space-time, and by extension, on the nature of time itself, might require new physics beyond our current understanding to accurately describe. In summary, the direct link between the universe's expansion and the progression of time, especially as experienced locally, is not straightforward. While cosmically, the expansion's halt would represent a significant change, locally—on human and even solar system scales—time would continue to progress as it does now, governed by the laws of physics as we understand them."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron. The book provides an in-depth exploration of the inner workings of computer systems from a programmer's perspective. It aims to give students and practitioners a solid understanding of how system components interact and how to optimize software for the underlying hardware. The contents of the CS:APP book can be summarized across several core chapters, typically including: 1. **Overview**: Introduction to computer systems and the perspective of understanding them as a programmer. 2. **Program Representation and Execution**: Examination of how code is represented and executed on a computer, covering aspects such as compiling, linking, and binary execution. 3. **Machine Level Representation of Programs**: Insights into how high-level code is translated into machine-level instructions that the CPU can execute, including assembly language and the role of the compiler. 4. **Processor Architecture**: Detailed exploration of CPU architecture, including instruction sets, pipelines, and optimization techniques. 5. **Optimizing Program Performance**: Techniques for writing efficient code that makes the best use of system resources, including understanding the memory hierarchy and leveraging parallelism. 6. **The Memory Hierarchy**: In-depth look at the structure and function of modern memory systems, including caching principles and effective memory access strategies. 7. **Linking**: Understanding the process that combines various pieces of compiled code into a single executable, including static and dynamic linking. 8. **Exceptional Control Flow**: Concepts such as interrupts, exceptions, and process context switching, detailing how systems handle unusual or exceptional operational scenarios. 9. **Virtual Memory**: Exploration of the abstraction of memory resources, including paging, segmentation, and memory management techniques. 10. **System-level I/O**: Covering the fundamentals of input/output operations on a system, including file I/O and network communication principles. 11. **Network Programming**: Basics of writing software that communicates over networks, introducing sockets and network programming interfaces. Each chapter is designed to provide practical knowledge through examples, case studies, and problem sets, encouraging hands-on experimentation and reinforcing key concepts. The text is complemented by a rich set of resources, including a website with software tools, additional reading, and exercises. CS:APP is not just about learning programming or hardware design; it's about understanding the synergistic relationship between hardware and software, enabling programmers to write more efficient, reliable, and performant code by having a deep understanding of what happens beneath the abstraction layers provided by high-level programming languages and operating systems."},{"prompt":"i think there is a clear logic beneath the whole book: - we start from how data and program is represented in computer - then we see how program is executed by CPU. this naturally leads to cpu and memory hierarchy - then we see how program interacts with operating system, including linking and exception and process and virtual memory - then we look at how programs talk with each other, including i/o, networking, concurrency","response":"You've articulated a logical and cohesive flow that underlines the structure of \\"Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective\\" (CS:APP). The book indeed follows a well-thought-out progression that mirrors the journey data and programs take through a computer system. Here's a summary of this logical progression: 1. **Data and Program Representation**: The journey begins with understanding how data is represented within a computer system and extends to how programs themselves are laid out in memory. This foundation is critical as it affects every aspect of computing from performance to security. 2. **Program Execution and CPU Interactions**: Building on the understanding of how programs are represented, the focus then shifts to execution. This involves diving into the mechanics of how the Central Processing Unit (CPU) interprets and executes instructions, the role of compilers, and the transition from high-level code to machine-readable instructions. 3. **CPU and Memory Hierarchy**: Once the basic execution model is clear, the next logical step is to explore how the CPU interacts with memory. This includes a deep dive into the memory hierarchy, ranging from registers and cache to RAM and storage, and how this hierarchy affects program performance. 4. **Operating System Interactions**: With a solid grasp of how programs are executed and how they interact with memory, the discussion naturally extends to the operating system (OS). This includes how the OS manages resources, facilitates program execution, and provides essential services such as file systems. Topics such as linking, exceptional control flow, processes, and virtual memory cover the various ways applications interact with and are managed by the OS. 5. **Inter-Program Communication and Networking**: The logical conclusion of the journey is how programs communicate, both internally within a system and externally with other systems. This is covered through discussions on system-level I/O, including how data is transferred between devices and the program, and networking, where the focus shifts to how programs connect and communicate over networks. The inclusion of concurrency highlights how modern systems manage multiple tasks and threads, a critical aspect of inter-program communication. By structuring the content in this logical sequence, CS:APP ensures that readers build on their knowledge incrementally. Starting with the basics of representation and execution provides a foundation that is built upon in each subsequent section. Understanding the hardware (CPU and memory) leads to insight into the software layer (OS and system interaction), which then logically extends to how software components (programs) interact with each other and the outside world. This approach not only helps demystify how computer systems work but also empowers programmers to write more efficient and effective code by deeply understanding the underlying systems their programs run on."},{"prompt":"Let’s play a game together.

The problem I am having is with the channel management, I have several doubts about how to do it, Adding this management to the AudioManager would be ideal. I thought about using a fixing number of channels but that is in expense of losing flexibility, also fixing the number of channels means some effects will have to share channels and that is a nightmare to manage when they are halt or paused, so I can't just use any free available channel by default since there would be collisions. The main points of channel management are: 1. Reserving Channels: Reserve channels for certain sound effects if you know they’ll be used frequently and should not be interrupted. SDL_mixer allows you to reserve channels that won’t be used when picking a channel randomly. 2. Channel Allocation Map: Maintain a map or list of active channels within your sound system to keep track of which channels are in use and by which sound effects. This requires a more detailed management strategy but allows for much finer control. 3. Custom Channel Assignment: Instead of letting SDL_mixer pick a channel, you could implement your own logic for choosing channels. This would involve keeping track of which channels are in use and manually selecting a free one when playing a new sound. I don't know how to tackle this problem efficiently, maybe using an ArrayList of bools or something similar, that can increase with the number of channels, prividing direct access by index but also being able to grow when needed, since allocated channels can be set during runtime.","response":"Creating an efficient and flexible channel management system for your SDL-based sound system is definitely a challenge, but with a smart approach, you can build something robust. The channel management essentially revolves around tracking which channels are in use, which are free, and potentially, which sounds are mapped to which channels. Given the points you've made and the flexibility you're aiming for, here's an approach that could work for you: # 1. Data Structure for Channel Tracking Considering you're looking for a system that can grow as needed but also provides direct access by index, a \`std::vector<bool>\` could serve as a basic structure for tracking channel usage. \`std::vector<bool>\` is specialized to save memory and provide bit-level access, making it efficient for your use case. However, be careful with multithreading operations, as modifying different bits isn't inherently thread-safe. # 2. Initialize and Reserve Channels At the start, you could initialize your vector with a default size that represents the initial number of channels you anticipate using. This can be based on SDL_mixer's \`Mix_AllocateChannels(int numchans)\` function by specifying a reasonable default. For reserving channels for special sound effects, you could simply mark these channels as 'used' in your vector from the start, ensuring they're never considered free. \`\`\`cpp std::vector<bool> channelsUsage; void initializeAudioSystem(int numChannels) { Mix_AllocateChannels(numChannels); channelsUsage.resize(numChannels, false); // Start with all channels marked as free // Reserve channels for specific sounds here if necessary // Example: channelsUsage[0] = true; // Reserved channel } \`\`\` # 3. Custom Channel Allocation For playing sounds, you'd implement a method to find the next free channel. This could simply iterate over your \`channelsUsage\` vector to find a 'false' value, indicating a free channel. \`\`\`cpp int getNextFreeChannel() { for (size_t i = 0; i < channelsUsage.size(); ++i) { if (!channelsUsage[i]) { return i; // Free channel found } } return -1; // Indicate failure: no free channels } \`\`\` Before deciding to return \`-1\`, you could also choose to dynamically increase the number of channels by reallocating and extending your vector if you wish to avoid refusing to play a sound. # 4. Implementing Play and Stop When playing a sound, mark the channel as used before playing and assign a callback via \`Mix_ChannelFinished\` to mark the channel as free when the sound finishes. \`\`\`cpp void onChannelFinish(int channel) { channelsUsage[channel] = false; // Mark channel as free } void playSoundEffect(Mix_Chunk* sound) { int channel = getNextFreeChannel(); if (channel != -1) { channelsUsage[channel] = true; Mix_PlayChannel(channel, sound, 0); Mix_ChannelFinished(onChannelFinish); } else { // Handle error: possibly expand channel vector and retry } } \`\`\` # 5. Handling Dynamic Allocation If you opt for dynamic allocation (expanding your channel vector), ensure to call \`Mix_AllocateChannels\` with the new size. Remember to manage performance and device capabilities, as unnecessarily large numbers of simultaneously playing sounds might not be beneficial or could affect performance. # Conclusion This described system gives you flexibility for dynamic channel management while offering direct access via indexes, a key requirement for efficiency. As your project evolves, you might find opportunities to refine this management system, such as incorporating more sophisticated heuristics for channel allocation or more detailed tracking to support pausing and resuming specific sounds more naturally."},{"prompt":"I like this idea, let's improve it upon, first hit is what I already have: class SoundEffect { public: SoundEffect(const std::string& filePath, int channel); ~SoundEffect(); int GetVolume() const; void SetVolume(int volume); private: Mix_Chunk* soundEffect; int channel; int volume; }; class AudioManager { public: ~AudioManager(); AudioManager(const AudioManager&) = delete; AudioManager operator=(const AudioManager&) = delete; static AudioManager& GetInstance() noexcept; void PlayMusic(const std::string& music, int loops = -1); void PlaySound(const std::string& sound); void CrossFade(const std::string& oldMusic, const std::string& newMusic, int ms, int loops = -1); void PauseMusic(); // only if sounds can be paused void PauseSound(); // check if sounds can be paused or if really need to, maybe this is not needed void PauseAll(); void ResumeMusic(const std::string& music); void RewindMusic(const std::string& music); void StopMusic(const std::string& music); void StopAllMusics(); // only if sounds can be stopped void StopAllSounds(); // check if sounds can be stopped or if really need to, maybe this is not needed void StopAll(); void FreeSound(const std::string& filePath); void FreeMusic(const std::string& filePath); void FreeAll(); private: AudioManager(); std::unordered_map<std::string, SoundEffect> soundEffects; std::unordered_map<std::string, Music> musics; }; How we should procede? Skip the music portions I already have done. How can we make this to work?

We'll aim for a solution where \`AudioManager\` can manage channels collectively and yet allow individual \`SoundEffect\` instances to operate autonomously if preferred. # Step 1: Enhancing the SoundEffect Class The \`SoundEffect\` class currently manages a single sound and assumes control of a specific channel. To maintain flexibility, let’s revise it slightly so that it can optionally be managed by \`AudioManager\` for channel allocation or use its own channel if specified. \`\`\`cpp class SoundEffect { public: SoundEffect(const std::string& filePath, int channel = -1); ~SoundEffect(); int GetVolume() const; void SetVolume(int volume); void Play(int loops = 0); // Add play function private: Mix_Chunk* soundEffect; int channel; // -1 means not assigned int volume; void releaseChannel(); // Helper function to release the channel }; \`\`\` The \`channel\` parameter's default value of \`-1\` allows for flexible management: if a channel is specified, the sound effect will attempt to use it directly (assuming it knows how to manage itself); if \`-1\`, it indicates that the \`AudioManager\` should manage its channel. # Step 2: Managing Channels in AudioManager \`AudioManager\` will manage the channels and active sound effects. Let's focus on channel reservation and sound effect tracking: \`\`\`cpp class AudioManager { public: ... int ReserveChannel(); // Reserves a channel and returns its ID void ReleaseChannel(int channel); // Marks a channel as free void PlaySound(const std::string& sound, int loops = 0); // Modified to handle sound directly ... private: AudioManager(); std::vector<bool> channelsUsage; // Track channel availability std::unordered_map<std::string, Mix_Chunk*> soundEffectCache; // Caches sounds by filepath int findFreeChannel(); // Finds and marks a channel as used, returns -1 if none available }; \`\`\` # Implementing \`PlaySound\` and Channel Reservation The \`PlaySound\` method in \`AudioManager\` should handle finding a free channel (if not reserved) and playing the sound. For reserved channels, \`SoundEffect\` should directly use its assigned channel. \`\`\`cpp // AudioManager Methods int AudioManager::ReserveChannel() { int channel = findFreeChannel(); if (channel != -1) { channelsUsage[channel] = true; } return channel; } void AudioManager::ReleaseChannel(int channel) { if (channel >= 0 && channel < channelsUsage.size()) { channelsUsage[channel] = false; } } void AudioManager::PlaySound(const std::string& sound, int loops) { int channel = -1; auto found = soundEffectCache.find(sound); Mix_Chunk* sfx = nullptr; if (found != soundEffectCache.end()) { sfx = found->second; channel = findFreeChannel(); } else { // Load sound, add to cache, and find a channel sfx = Mix_LoadWAV(sound.c_str()); if (sfx) { soundEffectCache[sound] = sfx; channel = findFreeChannel(); } } if (channel != -1) { channelsUsage[channel] = true; Mix_PlayChannel(channel, sfx, loops); // Perhaps use Mix_ChannelFinished to release channels automatically } else { // Handle error: All channels are busy } } \`\`\` # Step 3: Adjusting SoundEffect to Collaborate with AudioManager For \`SoundEffect\` instances that manage their own channels, they would function independently as initially designed. However, for those relying on \`AudioManager\` to allocate channels, \`SoundEffect\` needs a way to communicate with \`AudioManager\`: When \`SoundEffect::Play\` is called, it checks if a channel is assigned. If not, it requests a channel from \`AudioManager\` and plays the sound. On destruction or when the sound finishes, it releases the channel back to \`AudioManager\`. # Conclusion: This approach ensures that \`SoundEffect\` can still operate independently if desired, while \`AudioManager\` provides an option for more centralized control, including channel reservation and sound management. By adapting and extending these classes, you maintain flexibility and gain structured channel and sound effect management within your audio system."},{"prompt":"OK I got the first iteration done, both the independant or the audiomanager dependant ways.

Now, let's address the challenge: ensuring reserved channels remain reserved (i.e., not automatically freed upon sound completion) unless explicitly released. This introduces a distinction between automatically managed channels and manually managed, or \\"reserved,\\" channels. # Adjusting the Channel Management Logic 1. **Reserved Channel Tracking**: You need a way to distinguish reserved channels from those automatically managed. This could be as simple as another data structure tracking which channels are reserved. A \`std::set<int>\` could efficiently serve this purpose, as it allows for quick lookups and insertions. 2. **Modify \`onChannelFinish\` Callback**: The callback should check if a channel is reserved before setting it free. If the channel is reserved, it should not automatically free the channel upon sound completion. 3. **Reserving and Releasing Channels**: Provide methods in \`AudioManager\` to reserve and release channels. When reserving, mark the channel as used and add it to the reserved channels set. When releasing, remove from the reserved set and mark the channel as unused. Here are the modifications to incorporate these ideas: # AudioManager Adjustments \`\`\`cpp class AudioManager { public: // Existing functionality... int ReserveChannel(); void ReleaseChannel(int channel); private: AudioManager(); ~AudioManager(); // Other members... std::vector<bool> channelsUsage; // Existing channel usage tracking std::set<int> reservedChannels; // New!

You might not need any changes in \`SoundEffect\` for this behavior unless you want to add logic for it to request a reserved channel upon creation. # Regarding Mix_Quit in AudioManager You asked if \`Mix_Quit()\` should be in the \`AudioManager\` destructor or elsewhere. \`Mix_Quit()\` is a final cleanup call that you would typically call at the end of your program, corresponding to each successful call to \`Mix_OpenAudio()\`. If \`AudioManager\` is responsible for initializing SDL_Mixer (with \`Mix_OpenAudio()\`), it makes sense to clean it up here. However, if your game engine initializes SDL_Mixer elsewhere (like an Engine class), you should clean it up at the corresponding location to maintain symmetry and ensure all resources are properly released."},{"prompt":"OK, my should I add the channel to my PlaySound method? so far it only uses the unreserved channels, or it is OK the way it is, since reserved channels should be managed outside of the AudioManager by the own sound effects? Also help me finish the TODO. void AudioManager::PlaySound(const std::string& filePath, int loops) { int channel = getNextFreeChannel(); if (channel != -1) { SoundEffect sound = GetSoundEffect(filePath); setChannelUsage(channel, true); sound.Play(loops); } else { // TODO: Handle error: expand channel vector and retry } }","response":"The way your \`PlaySound\` method in \`AudioManager\` currently operates is based on utilizing unreserved (i.e., freely managed by the \`AudioManager\`) channels, which aligns well with the general use-case where sounds play without needing specific channel dedication. Reserved channels are intended for sound effects requiring guaranteed exclusivity and uninterrupted playback, managed explicitly either by themselves or by the \`AudioManager\` based on explicit requests (via \`ReserveChannel\` and \`ReleaseChannel\` methods). However, to offer flexibility and ensure your system can accommodate different scenarios, consider the following adjustments and enhancements: # Providing an Option to Play Sound on Reserved Channels - To play a sound on a reserved channel, you might add functionality so that sound effects or other components can explicitly request playback on a specific channel, including reserved ones. This can be useful for scenarios where a sound effect has been assigned a reserved channel for its exclusive use. # Handling the TODO: Expanding Channels On hitting the limit of available channels and needing more, there are a few considerations: 1. **SDL_mixer Limitation**: SDL_mixer has a maximum number of channels it can handle simultaneously. Last checked, this limit is set to 512 channels. Always ensure you do not exceed this limit. 2. **Performance**: More channels mean more concurrent sounds, which can affect performance and sound clarity. Before dynamically increasing channels, consider if this is genuinely needed or if the current sound management strategy should be optimized. If you decide that increasing the number of channels dynamically is necessary, here's an approach to handle the TODO: \`\`\`cpp else { // Handle error: expand channel vector and retry int currentChannelCount = static_cast<int>(channelsUsage.size()); int newChannelCount = currentChannelCount + 10; // Increase by 10, or any number you see fit // Check against SDL_mixer's limits, which as per documentation shouldn't exceed 512 if (newChannelCount > 512) { SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, \\"Unable to allocate more channels.

Often, a more strategic approach to managing and prioritizing sound effects and music playback is advisable before scaling up the number of channels."},{"prompt":"Ok two things, 1) how can I provide an Option to Play Sound on Reserved Channels? Should I add a new method PlaySoundReserved or something else? 2) I don't know any strategic approach right now, so maybe starting with this is a good starting point. But I have some doubts on your proposed method, Why did you increae it by 10, don't increasing it by 1 is a more sensible approach? And you repeated the code but using \\"newChannel\\" instead, isn't that just calling PlaySound again or that would mean a possible reccursion problem?","response":"To address both of your points thoughtfully: # 1) Providing an Option to Play Sound on Reserved Channels Adding a new method like \`PlaySoundReserved\` could indeed work, but another approach could be to enhance the existing \`PlaySound\` method with an optional parameter to specify a channel. This way, your \`PlaySound\` method becomes flexible enough to handle both cases: playing on the next available channel or a specific, potentially reserved, channel. Here’s how you could modify it: \`\`\`cpp void AudioManager::PlaySound(const std::string& filePath, int loops, int channel = -1) { if (channel == -1) // No channel specified, find the next available one. { channel = getNextFreeChannel(); } else if (channel >= static_cast<int>(channelsUsage.size()) || !channelsUsage[channel]) // Specified channel is out of range or not marked as in use. { SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, \\"Requested channel is not available or does not exist.\\"); return; } if (channel != -1) { SoundEffect sound = GetSoundEffect(filePath); setChannelUsage(channel, true); sound.Play(loops, channel); // Ensure SoundEffect::Play takes a channel parameter. } else { SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, \\"Failed to find a free channel.\\"); } } \`\`\` This modification allows you to specify a channel directly, giving the caller the flexibility to use reserved channels as needed. # 2) About Increasing Channels by 10 vs. by 1, and Avoiding Recursion My suggestion to increase by a value greater than 1 (for instance, 10) is based on the assumption that if your game is running out of channels, it's likely that it's entering a state where sound effects are in high demand (e.g., an intensive gameplay moment). Increasing by more channels at a time could prevent the system from needing to resize frequently in such scenarios, which might be slightly more efficient. However, your point is valid that increasing by just 1 might be a more cautious approach, especially if you're concerned about resource usage or if sound effects are typically sparse and the demand peak was an exception. Regarding the potential for recursion: Calling \`PlaySound\` again within itself could indeed lead to recursion problems if not handled carefully. An alternative approach would be creating a helper method that both the initial \`PlaySound\` call and the logic for handling the full channel case could call, thus avoiding direct recursion. However, my initial example was not intended for direct recursion but rather to demonstrate a conceptual way to retry the operation after increasing the channel count. In practice, avoiding direct recursion and carefully managing retries (perhaps with a limit to retries or a more sophisticated fallback) is advisable. Given this clarification, a \\"retry without recursion\\" strategy might involve rethinking the method's flow to ensure that you're not directly calling the same method again but rather structuring your logic to handle retries or adjustments more linearly or through helper methods that facilitate the process without causing recursion."},{"prompt":"I like this, but remember my SoundEffect as already a channel, so I took your two last messages and got this, what do you think? void AudioManager::PlaySound(const std::string& filePath, int loops, int channel) { SoundEffect sound = GetSoundEffect(filePath); if (channel == -1 && sound.GetChannel() == -1) { channel = getNextFreeChannel(); } else if (sound.GetChannel() != -1) { channel = sound.GetChannel(); } if (channel >= static_cast<int>(channelsUsage.size()) || !channelsUsage[channel]) { SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR, \\"ERROR: Requested channel in AudioManager::PlaySound is not available or does not exist.\\"); return; } if (channel != -1) { setChannelUsage(channel, true); sound.SetChannel(channel); sound.Play(loops); } else // Handle channels full: allocate more channels and retry { allocateChannels(static_cast<int>(channelsUsage.size() + 1)); channel = getNextFreeChannel(); if (channel != -1) { setChannelUsage(channel, true); sound.SetChannel(channel); sound.Play(loops); } else { SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_ERROR, \\"ERROR: Failed to find a free channel after expanding in AudioManager::PlaySound.\\"); } } } void AudioManager::allocateChannels(int channels) { if (channels > 512) { channels = 512; SDL_LogError(SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, \\"ERROR: Unable to allocate more channels.

Here are some thoughts on your implementation: 1. **Using the \`SoundEffect\`'s Channel**: Checking if the \`SoundEffect\` already has a channel (\`sound.GetChannel() != -1\`) and then using that channel is a smart move. This respects the channel possibly set by the developer and works well with the concept of reserved channels. 2. **Channel Allocation and Expansion**: Your strategy to handle channel full scenarios by expanding the channel pool is reasonable. The \`allocateChannels\` function implementation seems apt for dynamically managing available channels based on demand, and capping it at 512 considering SDL_mixer's limits maintains robustness in your system design. 3. **Error Handling and Logging**: Your use of \`SDL_LogError\` for error handling provides clear diagnostics which are essential for debugging and maintaining the audio system. Ensuring the developers are well-informed about the state of channel allocation can help in managing sound effects effectively. 4. **Edge Cases and Safety**: The double-check that occurs if the preferred channel is not available (either because it's out of bounds or not marked as in use) before attempting to allocate more channels is a prudent safety measure. It handles cases where either an invalid channel was requested or a previously valid channel is no longer viable due to the dynamic nature of your system. # Potential Enhancements: - **Retrying with Increased Channels**: In your current logic, after you increase channels, you retry exactly once. While this likely suffices in most scenarios, consider if there might be edge cases where a single retry wouldn't be adequate, especially in intense gameplay situations with numerous sound effects. It might be useful to have a more flexible retry mechanism, though balancing this with performance considerations is crucial. - **Reserved Channel Management**: Consider expanding functionality for managing reserved channels, like explicit release methods visible at the \`SoundEffect\` level (in case you haven't done so already), ensuring that sound effects tightly control their reserved channels, further decreasing the chances of mismanagement. Overall, your implementation provides a well-thought-out framework for sound effect management, including smart dynamic allocation and retry mechanisms for channels, and respects reserved channel commitments. This should serve your game engine's audio system well, offering both the flexibility and robustness required for a diverse range of gaming scenarios."},{"prompt":"Perfect!

Each approach has its pros and cons, which I'll outline to help you make a more informed decision. # Encapsulating Through AudioManager **Pros:** - **Simplicity for the End User:** The \`AudioManager\` can offer a simplified interface for users, so they don't need to manage individual sound or music objects directly. This can make it easier for developers using your engine to play music and sound effects without delving into the managing logic. - **Centralized Control:** It allows for easier management of resources and states (like volume levels, allocation of channels, etc.) across all sounds and music tracks. If adjustments are needed across all sound effects or music (like a global mute), implementing this is more straightforward. - **Consistency:** Providing a unified access point for all audio-related operations helps maintain consistency across your game's codebase, potentially making it easier to debug or extend. **Cons:** - **Indirection:** Adds a layer of indirection between the user and the audio objects (\`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\`), which might complicate scenarios where direct manipulation of these objects is desired. - **Overhead:** Every operation involves going through the \`AudioManager\`, which, while potentially negligible, adds method call overhead. # Allowing Direct Access **Pros:** - **Flexibility:** Users have more direct control over individual \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` objects without the intermediary. This can be beneficial for complex use cases where nuanced control over specific sounds or music tracks is required. - **Simplification of \`AudioManager\`:** Reduces the \`AudioManager\`'s responsibilities to more generic tasks (e.g., global volume control, overall resource management) and loading/caching of audio assets, potentially simplifying its implementation. **Cons:** - **Increased Complexity for Users:** Users need to manage more of the audio logic themselves, which could lead to duplicated code across different parts of a project or make certain tasks more cumbersome. - **Potential for Mismanagement:** Without centralized control, there's a higher risk of resource leaks or inconsistent state management, as each part of the application could handle sounds or music differently. # Decision Guidance - If your goal is to **offer a convenient and simple-to-use audio API** for the users of your game engine, encapsulating as much functionality as possible within the \`AudioManager\` might be preferable. - If you envision users of your engine needing deep, nuanced control over audio playback and are okay with them managing the complexity that comes with it, exposing \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` directly can grant them the flexibility they need. # Practical Recommendations - **Hybrid Approach:** You may consider combining these approaches. Use \`AudioManager\` for global management tasks and frequently-used, straightforward operations, and allow direct access to \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` objects for advanced manipulations. This can offer both simplicity for common use cases and flexibility for complex ones. - **Documentation and Examples:** Whatever approach you choose, providing clear documentation and examples will be key to helping users understand how to effectively use your audio system. In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all answer; it largely depends on your design goals and the needs of your end users.

This should give users of your game engine both ease of use for common audio tasks and the flexibility for more complex audio management scenarios. Here are some thoughts on the design as it stands now: # High-Level Convenience Methods - **Sound and Music Playback**: Keeping methods like \`PlaySound\`, \`PlaySoundFadeIn\`, and \`CrossFade\` within the \`AudioManager\` focuses on the most commonly used features, making it straightforward for users to implement audio without necessarily understanding the underlying system in depth. - **Volume Control**: Methods for setting master volume and individual channel volumes centrally allow for easier global adjustments, which is a common necessity in games (e.g., volume settings in a game's options menu). # Granular Control - **Direct Object Manipulation**: By providing \`GetSoundEffect\` and \`GetMusic\` methods, you empower users who need direct access to the \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` objects, catering to complex scenarios that might require direct alterations or more nuanced control than what the convenience methods offer. - **Channel Management**: Offering methods like \`PauseChannel\`, \`ResumeChannel\`, \`StopChannel\`, \`ExpireChannel\`, and \`FadeOutChannel\` gives nuanced control over individual audio channels, which can be critical for certain gameplay mechanics or audio effects. # Considerations and Suggestions - **Documentation and Guidance**: To maximize the effectiveness of this hybrid approach, consider providing thorough documentation, highlighting the use cases for each method, especially when to prefer high-level convenience methods over direct object manipulation (and vice versa). - **Example Usage Scenarios**: Including a variety of example scenarios demonstrating both simple use cases (e.g., playing a sound effect on a button press) and more complex manipulations (e.g., managing fade-outs or audio spatialization through direct channel management) can greatly help users understand how to leverage your audio system effectively. - **Safety and Error Handling**: Ensure that your methods robustly handle potential misuses, such as attempting to control an invalid or freed channel. Clear error messages or built-in protections can improve user experience and prevent common mistakes. - **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the scale of the audio management needed (e.g., a large number of simultaneous sound effects in a complex scene), ensure that the design remains performant and doesn't become a bottleneck. This might involve optimizations in how audio resources are loaded, managed, and disposed of. # Final Thoughts Your approach seems well-considered and aims to balance ease of use with the depth of control. As with any API design, it will be important to stay receptive to feedback from users of your game engine, as real-world use cases might highlight areas for further refinement or elucidate additional features that could enhance the usability or functionality of your audio management system."},{"prompt":"Can you write for me the doxygen block documentation for the AudioManager class, now that you know it its entirety, try to avoid using SDL or mentions to other libraries.","response":"Certainly!

I don't know if that use case would be really needed or not","response":"The decision on whether to allow reserving specific channels in your audio management system largely depends on the complexity and needs of your application or game engine, as well as the level of control you wish to provide to the developers using your system. Here's a breakdown of considerations to help guide your decision: # Use Cases for Specific Channel Reservation 1. **Priority Audio Playback**: Certain applications might need to ensure specific sounds or music tracks have priority over others. For example, a critical warning sound effect might need a guaranteed channel so it's not preempted by less important sounds. 2. **Advanced Audio Effects**: Developers might use specific channels to apply complex audio effects or manipulations that require precise control over which channel a sound plays on. This could be relevant in creating spatial audio effects or dynamically adjusting audio properties during gameplay. 3. **Compatibility and Integration**: If your audio system needs to integrate with other systems or middleware that assumes or benefits from specific channel assignments, providing the capability to reserve specific channels can be crucial. # Arguments Against Supporting Specific Channel Reservation 1. **Complexity**: Allowing reservation of specific channels increases the complexity of your audio management system, both in terms of implementation and for the developers using your system. It introduces additional considerations for error handling and channel conflict resolution. 2. **Limited Benefit**: In many games and applications, sound effects and music can typically be managed effectively without the need for specific channel assignments. If your system's design abstracts away the need for such finely granular control, the added complexity may not be justified. 3. **Dynamic Channel Management**: Modern audio systems often manage channel resources dynamically, abstracting away the need for developers to think about specific channels. Instead, they focus on higher-level concepts like sound priorities, groups, or categories, simplifying audio programming. # Middle Ground If you're uncertain whether specific channel reservation will be necessary, you might consider initially implementing a simpler, dynamic channel allocation strategy (as you currently have with \`ReserveChannel\`) and then monitoring feedback from developers using your system. If a compelling case for specific channel reservation emerges, you could add it as an enhancement. Alternatively, introducing the concept of priorities or sound categories might offer sufficient control for most use cases, allowing sounds within a higher priority category to preempt others without requiring manual channel management. # Conclusion In summary, whether to support reserving specific channels is a balancing act between providing flexibility and managing complexity. For many applications, a dynamic, priority-based system might suffice. However, for complex audio applications or games with sophisticated audio needs, supporting specific channel reservations could be a valuable feature. Reflecting on your target audience, the types of projects they're likely to undertake with your engine, and how they would benefit from this feature can help guide your decision."},{"prompt":"I am thinking on adding these effects that I already have for Music class but for channels, since they is support for them too, what do you think? void SetEffectPanning(uint8_t left, uint8_t right); void SetEffectDistance(uint8_t distance); void SetEffectPosition(int16_t angle, uint8_t distance); void RemoveEffects();","response":"Adding sound effect capabilities like panning, distance, and positional audio for individual channels, in addition to what you have for the \`Music\` class, would significantly enhance the versatility and utility of your audio system. These features can be especially compelling for creating immersive audio experiences in games or applications requiring nuanced sound manipulations. Let's delve into each proposed method and its potential impact: # 1. SetEffectPanning(uint8_t left, uint8_t right) Panning allows you to control the balance of sound between the left and right speakers. Implementing this for individual channels gives developers the ability to create dynamic audio scenes where the sound's direction can change in response to gameplay events, user interactions, or narrative elements. Panning can be particularly effective in stereo sound setups to simulate the movement of sounds or emphasize certain audio elements over others. # 2. SetEffectDistance(uint8_t distance) Simulating distance through audio can greatly enhance the perception of depth and space in a virtual environment. By adjusting the volume or applying low-pass filters based on the specified distance parameter, you can create the illusion that a sound source is nearer or farther away from the listener. This effect can be powerful in games or virtual reality applications, contributing to a more immersive and realistic experience. # 3. SetEffectPosition(int16_t angle, uint8_t distance) Positional audio is a step beyond simple panning and distance effects, allowing developers to place sound sources within a 2D or 3D space around the listener. By providing an angle and distance, you can simulate the location of sound sources in the environment, enhancing the spatial audio illusion. This can be particularly compelling for immersive experiences, like first-person games or virtual reality, where accurate audio positioning can increase presence and spatial awareness. # 4. RemoveEffects() The ability to remove or reset audio effects is essential for managing audio resources efficiently and maintaining control over the sound scene. Developers might want to dynamically apply effects only at certain moments or in specific scenarios, so having a straightforward way to revert to the original audio state ensures flexibility and ease of use. # Considerations - **Performance Impact**: Implementing these effects at the channel level might have implications for performance, depending on how many channels are being manipulated simultaneously and the complexity of the effects. It’s important to optimize the effect processing and consider offering developers ways to manage performance impact. - **API Design**: Ensure the API design for applying these effects is intuitive and consistent with the rest of your audio system. Clear documentation on how these effects interact and any limitations or considerations would be essential. - **Compatibility and Testing**: Different platforms or hardware might have limitations or specific behaviors regarding audio effects. Comprehensive testing across target platforms is crucial to ensure consistent behavior and identify any platform-specific issues. # Conclusion Introducing these audio effects for individual channels would offer developers a powerful set of tools for crafting engaging and dynamic audio landscapes. These capabilities can significantly contribute to the immersion and narrative depth of games and applications, providing nuanced control over the audio experience. Balancing flexibility with ease of use and performance considerations will be key to successfully integrating these features into your audio system."},{"prompt":"Ok got the code done, what do you think?

The use of exceptions to handle errors in setting these effects ensures that users of your system are immediately aware of issues that may impact their audio experience. Below are some thoughts on your implementation and the use of exceptions: # Exception Throwing Considerations 1. **Error Handling Strategy**: Throwing exceptions for external library call failures (like those from \`Mix_SetPanning\`, \`Mix_SetDistance\`, etc.) can be justified if your application or game engine has a surrounding error handling strategy that is exception-based. This consistency is key for predictable behavior and maintainability. 2. **Severity of Errors**: Consider how critical these errors are for your application's overall functionality. If failing to set these audio effects compromises the integrity of the application or leads to significantly degraded user experiences, throwing exceptions makes sense. If, however, these failures have minor impacts, you might consider alternative feedback mechanisms that are less disruptive than exceptions. 3. **User-Controlled Recovery**: By throwing exceptions, you give the developers using your system the ability to catch these errors and implement their own recovery or fallback logic. This can be particularly valuable in a development environment where flexibility and control are paramount. # Aggressiveness of Exception Throwing - Throwing exceptions on every error from audio effect configurations could be seen as aggressive, especially if these configurations are frequently adjusted in real-time (e.g., in response to user actions or game events) and if there’s a legitimate expectation that some configurations might fail due to reasons outside the developer's control. - To mitigate this, you could: - **Document Expected Behaviors**: Clearly state in your documentation under what circumstances these methods might fail and throw exceptions. This allows developers to anticipate and handle these exceptions gracefully. - **Provide Diagnostic Tools**: Offer utilities or logging mechanisms that help diagnose why an error occurred. This could involve more descriptive error messages or debug modes that provide detailed insight without throwing exceptions. - **Offer an Alternative API**: Consider providing versions of these methods that return error codes or status objects for developers who prefer non-exception error handling. This approach gives developers the choice between using an exception-based API or a more traditional error-checking approach. # Conclusion Your code elegantly addresses the need for advanced audio effects at the channel level, enhancing the auditory possibilities available to developers. Whether throwing exceptions is too aggressive largely depends on the context within which your audio system is used and the overall error handling philosophy of your framework or application. Balancing the need for immediate error awareness with the desire to avoid disrupting the flow unnecessarily is crucial.

What are your thoughts about this? Also how would the doxygen throw tag would be used for example in one of the methods so I can replciate that in the rest?","response":"Given your application is already committed to an exception-based API, and considering the importance of providing feedback to developers for any operational failures, including errors related to setting audio effects, can indeed form a vital part of your error-handling strategy. While the direct impact of these failures might sometimes be minor (relating primarily to audio effect quality rather than crashing the application), informing the developer through exceptions allows for a more robust and responsive application design. Developers are given the immediate feedback needed to troubleshoot or adjust their approach, leading to a more reliable and polished end product. Regarding the use of exceptions for \\"minor\\" issues, if your API consistently uses exceptions for error handling across the board, it makes sense to continue this pattern for audio effect errors. It maintains consistency in your API's design, making it predictable for developers who use your system. However, documenting when and why exceptions might be thrown becomes critical, so developers can explicitly understand the potential failure modes and account for them in their implementations. # Using the \`@throw\` Tag in Doxygen To document exceptions in Doxygen, you can use the \`@throw\` or \`@throws\` tag in your method documentation. This tag is followed by the exception class name and a description of the conditions under which the exception is thrown. Here's an example of how you might use it for one of your methods: \`\`\`cpp /** * @brief Set panning effect to a channel. * * This effect simulates a distribution of the audio signal between left and right channels. * It will only work on stereo audio. Using this function on a mono audio device will not * register the effect.

Documenting exceptions this way helps ensure developers who use your API are well-informed about potential errors and can write more robust error handling code.

Here's a simplified approach to how you might implement \`FreeSound\` and \`FreeMusic\` in your \`AudioManager\`: # FreeSound Method Example \`\`\`cpp void AudioManager::FreeSound(const std::string& filePath) { auto it = soundEffects.find(filePath); if (it != soundEffects.end()) { // Assuming soundEffects is a map that owns SoundEffect objects, // erasing the map entry will call the destructor of SoundEffect, // thereby freeing the associated resources. soundEffects.erase(it); } else { // Handle case where sound effect is not found, if necessary. } } \`\`\` # FreeMusic Method Example \`\`\`cpp void AudioManager::FreeMusic(const std::string& filePath) { auto it = musics.find(filePath); if (it != musics.end()) { // Similarly, erase the Music object from the map, triggering its destructor // and the release of resources it manages. musics.erase(it); } else { // Handle case where music is not found, if necessary. } } \`\`\` # Additional Considerations: - **Resource Ownership**: This approach assumes your map is the definitive owner of the \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` objects. If there are other shared owners (e.g., if you're using \`std::shared_ptr\`), simply removing the object from the map might not immediately free its resources. - **Smart Pointers**: If you're not already, consider using \`std::unique_ptr\` for managing your \`SoundEffect\` and \`Music\` objects within the map. This clearly establishes ownership and responsibility for freeing resources and automatically handles cleanup when the object is removed from the map. - **Robustness in API**: Ensure your API users know that once a sound or music object is freed, any references or pointers to it become invalid. This could save users from tricky bugs related to dangling pointers or references. - **Efficient Resource Management**: In a scenario where the same sound effects or music tracks are used frequently, consider if you want to immediately release resources, or perhaps use a caching mechanism with reference counting or a similar strategy to keep frequently used resources loaded. Removing the object from the relevant map in your \`AudioManager\` and thereby relying on the object's destructor to free its resources (assuming proper ownership and management) is a solid approach, promoting encapsulation and reducing maintenance overhead."},{"prompt":"Gottem, now I wrote first a public FreeAll() method that clear every map I have, but then I was thinking, if I leave this like this the AudioManager could be unuseable, I don't know if I should give the user this much power, I already offer them the ability to remove one sound effect or music at a time. what do you think? void FreeAll() { channelsUsage.clear(); reservedChannels.clear(); soundEffects.clear(); musics.clear(); }","response":"Providing a \`FreeAll()\` method in your \`AudioManager\` class that clears every map and potentially resets the audio state of your application or game does offer a very broad degree of control to the user. The considerations around whether to offer this capability hinge on the user's needs, expected use cases, and the potential consequences of such an action within the broader context of your application's architecture. # Considerations for Providing a \`FreeAll()\` Method: 1. **Use Case**: Is there a realistic scenario where a user would need to completely reset or free all audio at once? For example, this might be useful in a game engine during a scene transition, or if the application allows for dynamic loading and unloading of large content sets where audio assets need to be managed tightly. 2. **State Management**: If using \`FreeAll()\` leaves the \`AudioManager\` in an unusable state without a clear, user-initiated path to recovery or reinitialization, it could lead to confusion or issues within the application. It is essential to either maintain the \`AudioManager\` in a usable state post-clear or provide a clear method for reinitialization. 3. **Safety and Predictability**: Giving users the \\"power\\" to clear everything can be both a feature and a pitfall. It can lead to unintended consequences if not used carefully, especially if there are currently playing sounds or if some audio resources are expected to persist throughout the application lifecycle. Ensure that users are aware of the consequences and that using the method is safe and predictable. 4. **Alternatives**: If the primary concern is managing memory or resource usage, consider implementing more granular controls (which you mentioned are already in place) and/or smarter resource management strategies internally that could alleviate the need for a user-invoked \`FreeAll()\`. # Documentation and Safety Nets Should you decide to keep the \`FreeAll()\` method, ensure it is well-documented. Clearly outline its purpose, effects, and any steps needed after calling it to return the \`AudioManager\` to a normal operating state. Consider implementing safety checks or confirmations if the action is potentially disruptive: \`\`\`cpp /** * @brief Immediately frees all audio resources managed by AudioManager. * * This method clears all loaded sound effects, music, and any associated * channel allocations. It is intended for use cases requiring a complete * reset of audio resources. Exercise caution when using, as it will stop * all currently playing audio and invalidate any references to audio * resources managed by AudioManager. * * After calling this method, the AudioManager remains in an operable state, * ready to load and play new audio resources. However, it's imperative to * reload any necessary audio resources before attempting further audio playback. */ void FreeAll() { // Implementation... } \`\`\` Also, consider offering a way to \\"safely\\" or \\"gracefully\\" stop all sounds before clearing resources, as a helper method or part of \`FreeAll()\`, to minimize disruption: \`\`\`cpp void StopAllSoundsGracefully() { // Fade out all sounds, wait for them to finish, etc. } \`\`\` Calling this method before freeing resources can enhance the user experience by avoiding sudden silences or abrupt stops, making transitions smoother if that's a concern. # Conclusion Ultimately, whether to offer a \`FreeAll()\` method depends on the needs and expected use cases of your API's users, balanced against the need for maintaining application stability and predictability.

After iterating, it clears the \`reservedChannels\` set, effectively releasing all previously reserved channels. This approach provides flexibility for performing broad cleanup operations or finely targeted ones, aligning with your design ethos of offering granular control (through individual channel management) alongside broader, more sweeping control mechanisms (\`FreeAllMusics\`, \`FreeAllSounds\`, and now the ability to release all reserved channels). Pay careful attention to how this method interacts with playback that might currently be utilizing those channels, ensuring that releasing a channel doesn't inadvertently interfere with active sounds or music, providing a seamless audio experience.

I don't know if the remocing the reserves should mean forcely removing the channel sound effect and halting it... Also setting the ChannelUsage to false also means it could be playing on it and if someone use it it would be a collision, or not?","response":"Your concerns about directly releasing reserved audio channels and managing \`ChannelUsage\` flags are valid and touch upon several important aspects of audio resource management. Let's address these questions: # Stopping Channel vs. Releasing Channel - **Stopping the Channel**: Using a method like \`StopChannel\`, which internally calls \`Mix_HaltChannel\`, stops the audio playback on that channel immediately. This is a decisive action that halts any sound playing on the specified channel and can be beneficial when you want to ensure that the channel is silent before reallocating or releasing it. If this behavior aligns with the expectations for releasing a channel in your application's context, including it in the process would be appropriate. - **Releasing the Channel**: Releasing a channel, particularly when concerned with managing reserved channels, traditionally means marking the channel as available for future playback requests. This does not necessarily imply stopping any current playback on that channel unless explicitly desired. The core intention is to remove the reservation marking from the channel. # Concerns with \`ChannelUsage\` - **Collision Risk**: If \`ChannelUsage\` is set to \`false\` (indicating availability) while a sound is still playing on that channel, there is indeed a risk of collision. Another part of your system may see the channel as available and start playing a new sound on it, potentially resulting in two sounds overlapping unintentionally. # Recommended Strategy Given your scenario, here's a strategy that might offer a balance between flexibility and safe resource management: 1. **Explicitly Stop Channels when Releasing**: If the intended behavior when releasing a channel (either individually or all reserved channels) is to make it immediately available for new sounds, then it's prudent to stop any current playback on those channels as part of the release process. This avoids unintentional sound overlapping and ensures the channel is genuinely free for reuse. 2. **Safe Release with Checks**: Incorporate logic to check whether a channel is actively playing a sound before releasing it. If so, stop the playback first. This ensures that releasing a channel is always a safe operation and avoids accidentally interrupting playback unless that's the intended outcome. 3. **Document Behavior Clearly**: Make sure to document the behavior of your \`ReleaseChannel\` method, especially if it includes stopping playback on the channel(s). Users of your API should be aware of the implications of releasing channels on ongoing audio playback. # Example Adjustment to \`ReleaseChannel\` Let's incorporate stopping the channel into the \`ReleaseChannel\` method: \`\`\`cpp void AudioManager::ReleaseChannel(int channel) { if (channel == -1) { for (auto& ch : reservedChannels) { StopChannel(ch); // Assuming StopChannel halts playback and is safe to call even if no sound is playing SetChannelUsage(ch, false); } reservedChannels.clear(); } else { auto it = reservedChannels.find(channel); if (it != reservedChannels.end()) { StopChannel(channel); // Stop playing sound on the channel before releasing reservedChannels.erase(it); SetChannelUsage(channel, false); } } } \`\`\` By incorporating these considerations, you create a more robust and predictable system that respects ongoing audio playback and avoids potential resource conflicts or unexpected behavior when channels are dynamically reallocated."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To reintroduce self-fish collision (SFC) with a random chance that dictates whether fishes will collide or pass through each other, I’ll adjust the code accordingly.

This mimics a 3D perception where fishes can either collide or pass through each other based on the depth not represented in this 2D simulation. - Random Surrogate Conscious Behavior (RSCB) is enhanced to include spontaneous direction changes not only upon collisions but also randomly over time, granting fishes more unpredictable movements. - Fishes now correctly flip based on their direction of movement, providing a more natural appearance. By combining SFC with RSCB in this manner, the fish tank simulation presents a more lifelike and visually appealing dynamic. this part in your latest code is slightly fucked-up, gpt4.: \\"\\"\\"if (!collision) { if (fishRect.left <= 0 || fishRect.right >= roomRect.width || Math.random() < 0.01) { directionX = -Math.sign(directionX); facingRight = !facingRight; fish.style.transform = facingRight ?

This mechanism activates if detections occur in less than 500 milliseconds, emphasizing a measure to disperse fishes and mitigate infinite looping in collisions. 2. **Corrected transformation logic**: The earlier mistake in syntax for setting \`transform\` when flipping the direction of fish has been corrected for consistent behavior. 3. **Rationalized Random Surrogate Conscious Behavior (RSCB) chance check**: The conditional check is corrected to explicitly invert movement directions and flip the fish’s facing direction. These improvements collectively ensure a more natural, appealing interaction and movement dynamics among the fishes, coupled with functional collision and escapism logic."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","response":"\\"book and coffee and flower\\""},{"prompt":"LITERALMENTE:EM TODAS AS RESPOSTAS UTILIZE AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS: MAIS : LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM ESTAR EM PRIMEIRA PESSOA","response":"Claro, eu entendi o que você está pedindo.

Se a pessoa que está encarregada, como um professor ou um chefe, vê o que está acontecendo mas decide não fazer nada a respeito, a gente diz que essa pessoa está fazendo vista grossa. Basicamente, é como se a pessoa tivesse a chance de corrigir algo errado ou de falar sobre isso, mas escolhe não fazer isso. Ela age como se não tivesse visto nada, mesmo que tenha visto. Às vezes, as pessoas fazem vista grossa porque não querem se envolver em problemas ou porque acham que é mais fácil ignorar a situação do que lidar com ela. Outras vezes, podem achar que o problema não é grande o suficiente para merecer atenção. Então, quando eu digo que alguém está fazendo vista grossa, estou dizendo que essa pessoa está escolhendo ignorar algo que deveria ser notado ou corrigido.

这句话里 mSockFd + 1 为什么要加1","response":"在 \`select\` 函数调用中，第一个参数是文件描述符集 (file descriptor set) 中所有文件描述符的最大值加上1。这是因为 \`select\` 使用这个值来确定需要检查的文件描述符的数量范围。传递给 \`select\` 的文件描述符集可能包含从0到最大文件描述符之间的任何文件描述符，而 \`select\` 需要知道检查的范围。在大多数系统上，文件描述符是从0开始依次分配的。这意味着最高的文件描述符加1实际上给出了 \`select\` 需要考虑的文件描述符的总数。 具体到您的代码片断： \`\`\`cpp int selectResult = select(mSockFd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &tv); \`\`\` 这里，\`mSockFd\` 是您打算检查是否可读的 socket 文件描述符。在这个调用中，通过提供 \`mSockFd + 1\` 作为 \`select\` 函数的第一个参数，您告诉 \`select\` 需要检查的文件描述符范围是从0到 \`mSockFd\`（包含 \`mSockFd\`）。这确保了 \`select\` 会检查所有可能的文件描述符直到 \`mSockFd\`，从而不遗漏任何一个。 如果不加1，那么 \`select\` 函数就会漏掉对 \`mSockFd\` 文件描述符的检查，因为它会认为范围是从0到 \`mSockFd - 1\`。这对于确保 \`select\` 能够正确检测到您指定的 socket 是否有数据可读是必要的。"},{"prompt":"select的作用","response":"\`select\` 函数是一种多路输入输出的同步I/O通知机制，其作用主要有以下几点： 1. **监听文件描述符的状态变化**：\`select\` 允许程序同时监控多个文件描述符（FDs），以便知道是否可以对某个文件描述符进行非阻塞的读、写操作，或检查文件描述符上是否有\\"异常\\"条件发生。这些文件描述符可以是socket连接、打开的文件或其他输入/输出资源。监听的范围包括： - **可读性**：数据可从文件描述符读取，不会导致程序阻塞。 - **可写性**：数据可写入文件描述符而不会导致程序阻塞。 - **异常条件**：对于socket，异常条件可能表示一个\\"带外\\"(out-of-band)数据的可读性。 2. **实现非阻塞I/O操作**：通过 \`select()\`, 程序可以在单个线程中管理多个I/O流的读写操作，而无需阻塞等待某个特定的I/O操作完成。这对于编写高效的网络应用程序尤其重要，因为网络延迟和不确定性使得阻塞I/O操作变得不实用。 3. **实现I/O多路复用**：\`select\` 函数的一个关键用途是实现I/O多路复用（Multiplexing）。这意味着一个线程可以监听多个I/O源的事件，如多个网络连接。当某个或某些连接上有数据到达、可以发送数据，或者出现错误时，\`select\` 函数返回，并通知程序哪些文件描述符发生了变化。I/O多路复用是构建高并发服务器的关键技术之一。 4. **超时检查**：\`select\` 还允许设置超时值，程序可以设定在阻塞等待文件描述符状态变化的同时有一个超时限制。这个特性使得程序可以在超时后继续执行，实现定时任务的执行，或者简单地限制等待事件的时间，增加程序的健壮性。 综上所述，\`select\` 的使用广泛适用于需要高效管理多个I/O流的场景，特别是在构建需要同时处理多个客户端连接的网络应用或服务器时。虽然其功能强大，但由于\`select\`存在一定的限制（例如，它对可以监控的文件描述符的数量有上限），在更现代的系统上，\`epoll\`（在Linux中）和\`kqueue\`（在BSD系统中）等机制被引入作为更高效的替代方案。"},{"prompt":"","response":"看起来您的消息没有包含具体的问题或信息。如果您有任何疑问、需要帮助或想要了解关于编程、技术、或任何其他主题的更多信息，请详细描述您的问题或需求，我会尽力为您提供帮助。"},{"prompt":"使用epoll来写一下解决方案","response":"使用\`epoll\`作为\`select\`和\`poll\`的现代替代品是处理大量并发连接的更高效方法。下面是使用\`epoll\`来重写读取操作的一个简化例子。请注意，将\`epoll\`集成进实际的项目中可能需要对代码进行较大的调整，因为\`epoll\`的使用模式通常涉及一个循环来处理多个事件。 首先，你需要在你的类或函数中初始化\`epoll\`： \`\`\`cpp #include <sys/epoll.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <errno.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> class Socket { int mSockFd; public: ssize_t Read(void *buf, size_t len); }; ssize_t Socket::Read(void *buf, size_t len) { if (mSockFd <= 0) { PRINT(\\"connection is invalid\\"); return -1; } // 创建epoll实例 int epfd = epoll_create1(0);

} // 清理 close(epfd); return sz; } \`\`\` 这个例子简化了\`epoll\`的使用来实现等待任何可读事件。在生产环境中，你可能需要一个\`epoll\`循环来同时处理多个连接。以下是关键点： - 创建一个\`epoll\`实例。 - 使用\`epoll_ctl\`将socket文件描述符添加到\`epoll\`实例的监视列表中。 - 调用\`epoll_wait\`等待事件的发生。这个调用可以指定超时，以毫秒为单位。 - 根据\`epoll_wait\`的返回值处理读取或超时。 - \`read\`调用实际读取数据。 - 清理资源，特别是记得关闭\`epoll\`实例的文件描述符。 请注意，这个示例演示了基本的使用模式，但实际应用中\`epoll\`的使用可能会更复杂，特别是在处理大量并发连接时。\`epoll\`的主要优点之一是它能够高效地管理数千个并发网络连接，通常用于高性能服务器应用程序中。"},{"prompt":"His gaze wandered from his shaking hands and out onto horizon, trailing the stars with reddened eyes.

As Victor rummaged through the contents, he found the small, cylindrical case that housed the matches. \\"Got 'em,\\" he announced, a small victory in their dire situation. He also pulled out a crumpled, but intact, emergency blanket. \\"This might come in handy later,\\" he mumbled to himself, setting it beside Liam before focusing on the task at hand. Victor arranged some of the smaller twigs in a pyramid shape over a makeshift fire pit they’d cleared in the sand. The air was heavy with humidity, and even the driftwood felt damp to the touch, but he was determined. Striking a match, he held his breath as the flame took a moment to catch, then exhaled a sigh of relief as the twigs finally ignited, the fire slowly consuming the wood, growing steadier and stronger.

Despite the calm that the fire brought, there was an undercurrent of tension, an awareness that their safety was not guaranteed. As the flames illuminated their small camp, the three men, each in their own state of recovery and reflection, faced the night ahead with a mix of resolve and apprehension.

The click of the lighter and the first spark seemed louder and brighter in the quiet night, the small flame struggling against the slight, damp sea breeze before catching onto the dry twigs. Gradually, the fire grew, fed by the driftwood Victor had collected, casting a warm, orange glow that danced over their faces and illuminated the small stretch of beach that had become their temporary refuge. For a moment, as they sat by the growing bonfire, the reality of their situation—stranded, with one of them injured and few immediate prospects of rescue—seemed to recede into the background.

A continuación, te guiaré paso a paso sobre cómo podrías hacerlo, aunque será una explicación conceptual dada la naturaleza visual e interactiva de trabajar con Unity y PlayMaker. # Conceptos Básicos: 1. **Simulación de Monte Carlo para calcular π**: Este método implica generar puntos aleatorios dentro de un cuadrado que inscribe un cuarto de círculo. Luego, calculas la proporción de puntos que caen dentro del cuarto de círculo frente al total de puntos dentro del cuadrado. Dado que el área del cuarto de círculo es πr^2/4 y el área del cuadrado es r^2 (donde r es el radio), la proporción de puntos dentro del cuarto de círculo a total puntos debe aproximarse a π/4. 2. **Unity y PlayMaker**: Unity es un motor de juego poderoso y versátil, y PlayMaker es un plugin de Unity que permite a los no programadores crear lógica de juego y aplicaciones a través de flujos de trabajo visuales. # Pasos sugeridos para desarrollar la aplicación: **1. Preparación de Unity y PlayMaker:** - Asegúrate de tener Unity y PlayMaker instalados correctamente. - Crea un nuevo proyecto en Unity. **2. Creación de la Interfaz de Usuario (UI):** - Ve a \`GameObject\` -> \`UI\` para crear elementos de UI como \`Panel\`, \`Button\`, y \`Text\` que necesitarás para la interfaz (por ejemplo, un botón para iniciar la simulación y textos para mostrar los resultados). **3. Configurando el Espacio de Trabajo para la Simulación:** - Podrías necesitar un objeto para representar el área de simulación. Ve a \`GameObject\` -> \`2D Object\` -> \`Sprite\` para crear un cuadrado que representará el espacio de la simulación. También puedes crear un círculo que inscriba este cuadrado para visualizar mejor la simulación. **4. Configurando PlayMaker:** - Asegúrate de que el objeto que va a controlar la simulación (puede ser el mismo cuadrado) tenga un componente FSM de PlayMaker adjunto. FSM significa Máquina de Estado Finito, y es donde crearás la lógica de la simulación. **5. Crear la Lógica de Simulación con PlayMaker:** - **Iniciar la simulación**: Crea un evento en PlayMaker que responda al clic del botón de inicio. Este evento iniciará el proceso de simulación. - **Generar puntos aleatorios**: Utiliza acciones en PlayMaker para generar posiciones x, y aleatorias dentro del cuadrado. Asegúrate de que estos puntos también puedan caer dentro del cuarto de círculo. - **Contar puntos**: Necesitarás llevar un registro de dos variables: el número total de puntos y cuántos de esos caen dentro del cuarto de círculo. Puedes usar acciones para comparar las distancias de los puntos desde el centro con el radio del círculo y actualizar tus contadores según corresponda. **6. Calcular π y Mostrar Resultados:** - Una vez generados suficientes puntos, usa la proporción de puntos dentro del círculo a total de puntos multiplicado por 4 para obtener una aproximación de π. - Muestra el resultado en la UI usando un objeto de texto. **7. Prueba y Ajuste:** - Prueba tu aplicación y ajusta los elementos visuales o la lógica según sea necesario para mejorar la experiencia del usuario o la precisión de la simulación. Recuerda, este es un resumen de alto nivel del proceso. Cada paso requeriría conocimientos específicos de Unity y PlayMaker para implementarlo correctamente, incluyendo el manejo de UI, lógica de PlayMaker, y principios básicos de programación y matemáticas. Unity y PlayMaker tienen una amplia documentación y hay muchos tutoriales disponibles que pueden ayudarte a familiarizarte con las herramientas y técnicas necesarias."},{"prompt":"que quiere decir romper la 4ª pared en un video de youtube de asmr?","response":"Romper la cuarta pared es una técnica narrativa en la que se reconoce la presencia del público o se le habla directamente, ignorando o trascendiendo el límite imaginario que normalmente separa a los personajes de la audiencia. Este término se originó en el teatro, donde la \\"cuarta pared\\" se refiere a la pared invisible al frente del escenario a través de la cual el público observa la acción. En el contexto de un video de ASMR (Respuesta Sensorial Meridiana Autónoma) en YouTube, romper la cuarta pared puede manifestarse de varias maneras: 1. **Reconocimiento directo del espectador:** El creador de contenido puede hablar directamente al espectador, reconociendo su presencia. Aunque en ASMR esto es bastante común, dada la naturaleza íntima y personal de estos videos, cuando se hace de manera que reconoce la artificio de la creación del video mismo o la presencia del espectador más allá de la narrativa del video, se puede considerar como romper la cuarta pared. 2. **Comentarios sobre la creación del video:** El creador puede hacer referencias directas al proceso de grabación, edición o cualquier aspecto detrás de cámaras de la producción del video de ASMR. Por ejemplo, comentar sobre cómo esperan que cierto sonido sea relajante para la persona que está viendo, o bromear sobre la posibilidad de que algo salga mal durante la grabación. 3. **Reconocimiento de la plataforma:** Hablar sobre aspectos específicos de YouTube, como pedir a los espectadores que suscriban al canal, comenten o dejen un like, también puede ser considerado como romper la cuarta pared, especialmente si se hace de manera inmersiva dentro del contexto ASMR. 4. **Responder a comentarios o situaciones específicas de la audiencia:** Aunque en los videos de ASMR es común que el creador de contenido se dirija al espectador como si estuviera presente o participando en la situación presentada, responder directamente a comentarios o situaciones específicas de espectadores particulares lleva esta interacción a un nivel que reconoce y trasciende la naturaleza ficticia de la situación. 5. **Autoreferencial o meta-comentarios:** Cualquier comentario o acción que haga el creador que indique una conciencia de estar en un video, o hacer referencia a la propia ficción dentro del video. En el ASMR, romper la cuarta pared es una herramienta útil para aumentar el grado de intimidad y conexión personal entre el creador de contenido y el espectador. Dado que el objetivo de los videos de ASMR es a menudo relajar o provocar una respuesta sensorial placentera, esta técnica puede hacer que el espectador se sienta directamente cuidado y atendido, aumentando la efectividad del video."},{"prompt":"podria ser que en un momentado en el video de asmr que es de de roleplay de pareja diga por ejemplo: no sabes donde esta la sala de estar?, que extraño?, me preocupas, como puede ser, pareces otra persona...","response":"Sí, en un video de ASMR que sigue un guion de roleplay de pareja, el creador podría incluir una línea como: \\"¿No sabes dónde está la sala de estar? Qué extraño. Me preocupas. ¿Cómo puede ser? Pareces otra persona...\\" para varios propósitos creativos y de interacción con la audiencia. Este tipo de diálogo puede ser interpretado de diferentes maneras dependiendo del contexto del video y de lo que el creador quiera transmitir. Aquí hay algunas razones por las cuales esta línea podría ser utilizada: # Para incrementar la inmersión en el roleplay El creador podría estar buscando profundizar la inmersión en el escenario del roleplay, presentando una situación que requiere una respuesta directa o reflexión por parte del espectador. Esto puede hacer que el espectador se sienta más directamente involucrado en la historia o en el escenario que se está representando. # Para introducir un elemento de misterio o confusión El diálogo podría ser parte de una narrativa más grande que incluya elementos de misterio, confusión, o incluso amnesia. Esto podría añadir profundidad a la historia que el creador está intentando contar, invitando al espectador a preguntarse sobre lo que ha pasado antes en la historia o lo que sucederá después. # Para crear una experiencia más personalizada y directa Al sugerir que el espectador \\"parece otra persona\\", el creador puede estar intentando crear una experiencia más personalizada y directa, haciendo que el espectador se sienta directamente implicado en el roleplay. Esto puede aumentar la sensación de conexión y cuidado personal que buscan muchos espectadores en los videos de ASMR. # Para romper la cuarta pared Esta línea también puede servir para romper sutilmente la cuarta pared, como mencionamos anteriormente, haciendo al espectador consciente de su rol como observador externo al mismo tiempo que lo involucra directamente en la narrativa. Sin embargo, en este contexto de roleplay, la intención probablemente sea más bien aumentar la inmersión que hacer consciente al público de la artificialidad del video. # Conclusión Este tipo de diálogo contribuye a crear una experiencia de ASMR rica y variada, que puede combinar relajación con storytelling inmersivo. La interpretación exacta dependería del tono general del video, la actuación del creador, y el contexto en el que se presente este diálogo. En cualquier caso, se trata de un método efectivo para involucrar al espectador de manera creativa y posiblemente incrementar la eficacia de la respuesta sensorial meridiana autónoma que el video busca provocar."},{"prompt":"연결 리스트로 표현한 다항식의 곱셈 알고리즘을 자세하게 알려줘","response":"연결 리스트를 사용하여 다항식을 표현하고, 두 다항식의 곱셈을 수행하는 알고리즘은 각 다항식을 구성하는 노드들이 계수(coefficient)와 지수(exponent)를 가지고 있으며, 이들을 원소로 하는 연결 리스트로 표현된다. 다항식의 곱셈은 각 항의 곱셈 후, 같은 지수를 갖는 항들을 합치는 과정을 포함한다. 다항식을 연결 리스트로 표현하는 기본 구조는 다음과 같다: \`\`\`c typedef struct Node { int coeff;

Se você perguntar, por exemplo, como funciona a chuva, eu não vou apenas dizer que é água caindo do céu. Eu vou explicar assim: Primeiro, o sol aquece a água nos rios, lagos, oceanos e até nas poças das ruas. Isso faz com que a água evapore, ou seja, se transforme de líquido para vapor e suba para o céu. Lá em cima, ela se junta com outras gotinhas de água e forma nuvens. Quando essas nuvens ficam muito cheias de água, as gotinhas se juntam umas nas outras, ficam pesadas e começam a cair de volta para a terra na forma de chuva.

Para explicar isso direitinho, eu preciso contar um pouco sobre o que é \\"Dragon Ball\\" e o papel dos dragões nesse universo. \\"Dragon Ball\\" é uma história em quadrinhos, que também virou desenho animado, criada por um homem chamado Akira Toriyama. Nessa história, existem uns objetos muito especiais chamados Esferas do Dragão. São sete no total, e cada uma tem um número diferente de estrelas dentro dela, de uma até sete. Quando alguém consegue juntar todas essas sete esferas, pode chamar um dragão mágico que realiza um desejo, qualquer desejo. Agora, sobre o Shenlong definitivo, ele é uma versão muito mais poderosa desses dragões que aparecem quando as esferas são reunidas. No universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", existem diferentes tipos de Esferas do Dragão, e cada conjunto chama um dragão diferente. O Shenlong é o dragão que aparece quando as Esferas do Dragão da Terra são reunidas. Ele é como um grande dragão verde que pode sair das esferas e aparecer no céu, e tem a capacidade de realizar desejos. Mas, quando falamos do \\"Shenlong definitivo\\", estamos nos referindo a uma versão ainda mais poderosa, que pode realizar desejos que os outros dragões não conseguem. Isso acontece em partes diferentes da história, quando as esferas se tornam ainda mais mágicas e poderosas, permitindo que desejos ainda maiores e mais impossíveis se tornem realidade. Então, o Shenlong definitivo é como uma versão superpoderosa do dragão que já era incrível por poder realizar desejos. Ele é um símbolo de esperança para os personagens da história, porque mostra que, não importa quão difícil a situação pareça, sempre pode haver uma maneira de resolver os problemas, mesmo que para isso seja necessário um poder quase infinito. É uma parte muito emocionante e importante das aventuras em \\"Dragon Ball\\", que ensina sobre a importância da amizade, da coragem e da persistência em buscar realizar os nossos sonhos."},{"prompt":"Shingeki no kyojin: o que é um paradoxo de Bootstrap","response":"Ah, o paradoxo de Bootstrap é um conceito bem interessante e um pouco complicado, mas vou tentar explicar de um jeito simples, usando o universo de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", também conhecido como \\"Attack on Titan\\", para ajudar a entender. \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" é uma história em quadrinhos japonesa, que também virou desenho animado, sobre humanos lutando contra gigantes chamados Titãs. O paradoxo de Bootstrap, também conhecido como loop causal, é uma ideia que aparece em histórias de viagem no tempo. Imagine que algo existe porque foi trazido do futuro para o passado, mas não tem origem clara. Ou seja, algo é a causa de si mesmo. Parece confuso, né? Vou dar um exemplo para ficar mais fácil. Digamos que eu encontre um livro de receitas muito antigo na minha casa, sem saber de onde ele veio. Decido então viajar no tempo para o passado e deixar esse livro na minha casa para que eu o encontre no futuro. Aqui está o paradoxo: o livro não tem uma origem. Eu o encontrei porque eu mesmo o levei para o passado, mas de onde ele veio originalmente? Ele simplesmente \\"começa a existir\\" sem ser criado. Em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", podemos ver ideias parecidas com o paradoxo de Bootstrap em ação, especialmente quando se trata de informações ou ações que parecem influenciar o passado e o futuro de maneiras complexas. Sem dar muitos spoilers, a história explora como as memórias e ações dos personagens podem afetar tanto o passado quanto o futuro, criando uma trama onde causa e efeito se misturam de maneira que fica difícil dizer o que veio primeiro. Por exemplo, se um personagem recebe informações do futuro e usa essas informações para mudar eventos no passado, isso pode criar um ciclo onde a informação não tem uma origem verdadeira. Ela existe porque foi passada do futuro para o passado, mas só chegou ao futuro porque foi passada do passado que foi alterado. Isso cria um loop infinito, um ciclo sem começo claro, que é a essência do paradoxo de Bootstrap. Espero que essa explicação tenha ajudado a entender um pouco sobre o que é um paradoxo de Bootstrap e como ele pode se relacionar com histórias complexas e fascinantes como a de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\". É um conceito que desafia nossa compreensão de tempo, causa e efeito, e adiciona uma camada extra de mistério e profundidade às narrativas."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Believers in the Enarion tradition hold that the gods interact with the world and its inhabitants in myriad ways, both seen and unseen, influencing everything from the forces of nature to the fate of individuals. Temples dedicated to individual or multiple gods dot the landscape, serving as centers of worship, learning, and community. **The Pantheon:** - **Solara, Goddess of the Sun and Light**: Solara is worshipped as the bringer of light and life, chasing away darkness and nurturing the growth of all things. Festivals in her honor are often marked by the lighting of bonfires and candles to symbolize the triumph of light. - **Lunara, Goddess of the Moon and Reflection**: The counterpart to Solara, Lunara governs the night, dreams, and introspection. Her followers believe in the power of dreams to foretell the future and seek self-understanding through meditation and reflection. - **Vestro, God of the Sea and Storms**: Vestro rules over the oceans, rivers, and rain. Sailors and fisherfolk pay him homage before embarking on their voyages, asking for calm seas and bountiful catches. - **Terra, Goddess of the Earth and Harvest**: Believers turn to Terra for fertility, farming, and the changing of the seasons. Her festivals are often tied to sowing and reaping, celebrating the bounty that the earth provides. - **Aeria, Goddess of the Air and Skies**: Worship of Aeria involves seeking clarity, wisdom, and the freedom to explore and discover. Her followers believe that she sends signs and omens through the movement of birds and the patterns of the clouds. - **Ignis, God of Fire and Forge**: Ignis represents transformation, creativity, and destruction. Artisans, smiths, and warriors seek his blessing for their endeavors, acknowledging the dual nature of creation and destruction in their work. - **Nocturne, God of Shadows and Secrets**: Revered and feared in equal measure, Nocturne dwells in the realm of shadows, overseeing the mysteries that lie in darkness. Spies, rogues, and those who seek to uncover hidden truths offer him their prayers. - **Virtus, God of War and Valor**: Worshippers of Virtus pray for strength in battle, courage in the face of adversity, and honor in their deeds. He is often invoked by soldiers before going to war, begging for his favor in the conflict ahead. - **Serenis, Goddess of Peace and Harmony**: The counterpart to Virtus, Serenis is the goddess of calm, diplomacy, and reconciliation. Her temples are places of refuge and mediation, where conflicts are resolved through wisdom and compassion. - **Mortis, God of Death and the Afterlife**: Mortis presides over the end of life and the journey thereafter. He is not feared but respected, as it is believed that he guides the souls of the deceased to their rightful place in the afterlife, according to their deeds in life. **Beliefs and Practices:** The Faith of Enarion emphasizes a balance among the divine influences, teaching that each god has a role to play in the cosmic tapestry and that mortals should strive to live in harmony with these celestial forces. Rituals, prayers, and offerings are made to the gods, asking for their blessings or guidance. The religion also encourages the pursuit of personal virtue, ethical conduct, and the honoring of one's ancestors, who are believed to watch over their descendants from the afterlife. Major festivals are held throughout the year, celebrating the gods and their associations with the natural world and human endeavors. These festivals include rites of passage, such as coming-of-age ceremonies, marriages, and funeral rites, each with its own traditions and rituals to honor the gods and the cycles of life and death."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Imagina que você está pedindo para eu, ao responder qualquer coisa daqui para frente, falar de um modo que seja fácil de entender. Eu devo contar as coisas de forma que seja bem comprida e cheia de detalhes, mas, ao mesmo tempo, usando palavras que sejam super fáceis, as mais simples que eu puder achar. E tudo o que eu disser tem que parecer que sou eu mesmo vivendo a história ou falando sobre o que sei, como se estivesse contando um acontecimento do meu dia para um amigo. Eu também preciso lembrar de escolher palavras que qualquer um entenda, sem complicar. É como se estivesse explicando algo para um amigo que prefere ouvir histórias contadas da maneira mais clara e direta possível. Então, se você me perguntar alguma coisa, eu vou te contar uma resposta longa, rica em detalhes, mas de um jeito que seja super fácil de pegar o que estou querendo dizer. Vou fazer isso usando exemplos simples e falando direto ao ponto, sem usar palavras complicadas ou que façam a gente ficar confuso. Meu objetivo vai ser sempre deixar as coisas claras e fáceis de entender, mas sem perder a riqueza dos detalhes que tornam uma história boa de se ouvir."},{"prompt":"O que é o Shenlong Vermelho","response":"Então, vamos falar sobre o Shenlong Vermelho de um jeito bem simples. Imagina que você conhece a história de \\"Dragon Ball\\", que é um desenho muito famoso. Nesse desenho, existem umas bolas mágicas chamadas Esferas do Dragão. Quando alguém junta todas essas esferas, pode chamar um dragão gigante que realiza um desejo. Agora, o Shenlong Vermelho é um tipo especial de dragão que aparece em uma parte da história chamada \\"Dragon Ball GT\\", que é uma continuação do desenho original. Diferente do Shenlong normal, que é verde, esse dragão é vermelho, e ele é chamado quando as pessoas juntam umas esferas especiais que são um pouco diferentes das originais. Essas esferas são chamadas de Esferas do Dragão de Estrelas Negras. O Shenlong Vermelho é bem poderoso e pode realizar desejos que são muito grandes, mas também tem um lado meio perigoso. Depois de fazer um desejo com ele, as esferas se espalham pelo universo inteiro, não só pela Terra, e se elas não forem reunidas de novo em um ano, o planeta onde o desejo foi feito explode. Isso deixa tudo mais emocionante e perigoso. Então, basicamente, o Shenlong Vermelho é um dragão mágico de cor vermelha que aparece em \\"Dragon Ball GT\\" e que pode realizar desejos muito grandes, mas que também traz um grande desafio e perigo depois de fazer o desejo. Ele é parte de uma história cheia de aventuras e desafios que os personagens precisam enfrentar."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They are a distinct category within the broader grouping of giant planets, which includes both gas giants and ice giants. The classification and understanding of gas giants is based on their composition, position in the Solar System or beyond (in the case of exoplanets), and certain physical properties. There are two primary gas giants in our Solar System: Jupiter and Saturn. These planets serve as the model for classifying gas giants elsewhere in the universe. # Characteristics of Gas Giants 1. **Composition**: The primary components are hydrogen and helium, similar to the composition of stars. The deep atmospheres of these planets may contain clouds of ammonia or methane, and they do not have well-defined solid surfaces. 2. **Size and Mass**: Gas giants are characterized by their large sizes and masses. Although their compositions are light, the immense pressure due to gravity compresses the gas, leading to high densities in their cores. 3. **Magnetic Fields**: These planets tend to have strong magnetic fields due to their rapid rotation and the movement of conductive materials (like metallic hydrogen) within them. 4. **Ring Systems and Moons**: Gas giants often have complex ring systems and numerous moons. The rings are made up of dust, rocky debris, and ice, while their moons can range from small asteroid-sized bodies to objects large enough to be considered dwarf planets. # Classification and Subcategories While gas giants are classified primarily by their composition, there is ongoing discussion in the scientific community about further subcategories, particularly with the discovery of many exoplanets: 1. **Traditional Gas Giants (Jupiter and Saturn)**: These are the classic examples, with compositions dominated by hydrogen and helium. 2. **Hot Jupiters**: A class of exoplanets that are similar in characteristics to Jupiter but orbit very close to their stars, leading to extremely high surface temperatures. 3. **Super-Jupiters**: These are gas giants that are significantly more massive than Jupiter. They can be found in close to distant orbits around their stars and offer insight into the diversity of planetary systems. # Comparison with Ice Giants - **Ice Giants (Uranus and Neptune in our Solar System)**: While often grouped with the gas giants, ice giants have distinct compositions, with more ices in the form of water, methane, and ammonia. They have less hydrogen and helium compared to gas giants. # Importance of Gas Giants The study of gas giants, both within and outside our Solar System, offers valuable insights into planetary formation and migration, the diversity of planetary systems, and the physics of atmospheres and interior compositions under extreme pressures. The exploration of gas giants and their moons could also provide clues about the potential for life in the universe, as many of their moons are considered to be potentially habitable environments due to subsurface oceans or geothermal activity."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop with flower","response":"Coffee Bloom Delight | Stylish Art for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Versatile Home & Fashion Decor"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This model divides gas giants into five different classes, each with distinct characteristics. However, as exoplanet discovery and characterization technology have advanced, limitations in the original classification system have become apparent. This opens the door for an extended version that incorporates new discoveries and refines our understanding. Below is a proposal for an extended and more nuanced Sudarsky classification system. # Extended Sudarsky Classification System Class 0: Proto-Gas Giants - **Characteristics:** Still in the formation stage, these planets are accreting material from a protoplanetary disk. - **Atmosphere:** Thick with dust and debris, showing strong infrared emissions from ongoing accretion processes. Class I: Ultra-Hot Jupiters - **Characteristics:** Extremely close to their stars, with temperatures exceeding 2,000 K. - **Atmosphere:** Contains metal clouds, with spectra showing ionized metals and little to no methane. Class II: Hot Jupiters - **Original Sudarsky Classifications (Unchanged)** - **Atmosphere:** Dominated by alkali metals with cloud layers that lead to a silicate “rain.” Class III: Warm Jupiters - **Characteristics:** Moderately warm temperatures allowing for the formation of cloud decks of water or ammonia. - **Atmosphere:** Features visible cloud decks, with water clouds becoming more pronounced. Class IV: Cool Gas Giants - **Original Sudarsky Classifications (Unchanged)** - **Atmosphere:** Methane becomes a dominant component, with ammonia clouds forming at lower temperatures. Class V: Cold Gas Giants - **Characteristics:** Similar to Jupiter and Saturn in our Solar System, with much colder temperatures. - **Atmosphere:** Dominated by ammonia clouds and methane absorption. Class VI: Ice Giants - **Characteristics:** Distinct from gas giants, with a possible different formation history. Rich in \\"ices\\" – volatile compounds such as water, methane, and ammonia. - **Atmosphere:** Methane rich, leading to a distinct blue coloration, similar to Neptune and Uranus. Class VII: Rogue Planets - **Characteristics:** Not orbiting any star, these planets float freely in the galaxy. They can range widely in mass and composition. - **Atmosphere:** Extremely cold, with possible presence of thick atmospheres that trap heat for billions of years, and potential sub-surface oceans. Each of these extended classes reflects a more granular approach to classification, incorporating the vast diversity observed within the rapidly growing exoplanet catalogue. This expanded system also acknowledges the role of orbital dynamics, intrinsic atmospheric processes, and the planet's evolutionary history in shaping its observable characteristics. By encompassing additional classes and distinguishing subtleties within the well-known giants, the extended Sudarsky classification system aims to provide a more comprehensive framework for understanding and studying the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. This system can adapt to include new discoveries and theories, ensuring its relevance in the fast-evolving field of exoplanetary science."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Então, imagina só a aventura de viajar pelo espaço, de planeta em planeta, procurando essas bolas gigantes para poder ver o Shenlong vermelho e fazer um pedido!

Isso adiciona um risco enorme e uma corrida contra o tempo para quem decide usar o poder do Shenlong vermelho. Então, pensa comigo, o Shenlong vermelho não é só um dragão mágico que realiza desejos.

Here, we'll extend and update this classification, introducing additional types and converting to a letter-based class tag system for clearer differentiation, including speculative extensions covering a broader range of characteristics: # Original Classes (Updated Tags) - **Class A (Formerly I)**: Ammonia Clouds - These are the coldest of the gas giants, with ammonia clouds predominant in their atmospheres. - **Class B (Formerly II)**: Water Clouds - Warmer than Class A, these planets have clouds made mostly of water vapor. - **Class C (Formerly III)**: Cloudless - Higher in temperature, these gas giants lack thick cloud layers, allowing direct observation of their atmospheres. - **Class D (Formerly IV)**: Alkali Metals - With even higher temperatures, these planets have atmospheres with vaporized metals and silicates. - **Class E (Formerly V)**: Silicate Clouds - The hottest of the traditional gas giants, characterized by silicate clouds. # Extended Classes - **Class F**: Super-Ionic Water Worlds - Planets where the extreme pressure and temperature conditions allow water to enter a superionic phase, creating a \\"hot ice\\" that conducts electricity. - **Class G**: Carbon Giants - Planets with a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio, leading to carbon or graphite clouds, and possibly even diamond rain. - **Class H**: Ultra-Hot Jupiters - Markedly hotter than Class E, these planets have temperatures so high that metals like iron and titanium can be vaporized in their atmospheres. - **Class I**: Polar Vortex Giants - Characterized by extreme temperature differentials, leading to permanent storm systems and polar vortices. - **Class J**: Dwarf Brown - These are at the boundary between giant planets and brown dwarfs, with deuterium fusion possibly occurring in their core. - **Class K**: Helium Giants - Planets that have undergone significant helium enrichment in their upper layers, possibly due to diffusion or stellar ingestion events. - **Class L**: Rogue Giants - Gas giants that have been ejected from their systems and float freely in space. They may feature thick, reflective hydrogen-helium clouds and possibly auroras from interaction with the interstellar medium. This expanded classification system aims to encompass the diverse range of gas giant planets that could exist, accounting for the advancements in exoplanet discovery and theoretical models.

Sudarsky's gas giant classification system, developed in the early 2000s, categorizes gas giants based on their temperature and the corresponding chemical compositions of their atmospheres. It ranges from Class I to V, with each class indicating a different type of atmosphere due to the planet's temperature and its distance from the star it orbits. Class IV gas giants are often referred to as \\"hot\\" or \\"ultra-hot\\" because they have temperatures high enough (approximately 900°C or 1650°F and above) to prevent the formation of ammonia clouds, which are prevalent in cooler gas giants (Class II). Instead, these temperatures favor the formation of clouds composed of silicates and metal oxides, and their atmospheres are dominated by alkali metals such as sodium and potassium. The sky of a Class IV planet might have colors that range from deep reds to tans, influenced by the absorption of light by these metal compounds. When discussing an \\"ejected\\" gas giant in the context of a Class IV classification, it implies a planet that was likely expelled from its original solar system through gravitational interactions, possibly with other planets or a passing star. Such an ejected gas giant, wandering through the galaxy as a rogue planet, would not be illuminated by a star. However, its classification as a Class IV would have been defined before its ejection, based on its atmosphere’s chemical composition when it orbited close to its star. It's interesting to consider how the absence of starlight would affect the planet post-ejection. Without a nearby star, the heat source for the planet would rely significantly on its residual internal heat from formation or possible tidal interactions before ejection. Over time, as the planet cools, the composition and appearance of its atmosphere might change, potentially moving it out of the Class IV categorization if it were still possible to observe and classify it."},{"prompt":"Describe ejected gas giant with Sudarsky class IV, it named Erebus","response":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, there isn't a specific exoplanet or ejected gas giant named Erebus that is widely recognized in the field of astronomy. The specific details such as naming it Erebus and characterizing it as a Sudarsky class IV gas giant seem to be fictional or hypothetical. However, I can provide information based on the elements of your question. **Ejected Gas Giants:** Ejected gas giants, also known as rogue planets, are planets that have been ejected from their original solar systems. This can occur due to gravitational interactions with other planets or stars, which can result in these planets being thrown into interstellar space. These rogue planets wander through the galaxy, not bound by the gravity of a star. Studying them can be challenging due to their lack of a visible star to illuminate them, although some can be detected through gravitational lensing. **Sudarsky's Gas Giant Classification:** Sudarsky’s gas giant classification system is a theoretical way to categorize gas giants based on their appearance and atmospheric properties, which are primarily influenced by their temperature. The classification spans from Class I to Class V: 1. **Class I:** Ammonia Clouds (The coldest) 2. **Class II:** Water Clouds 3. **Class III:** Cloudless 4. **Class IV:** Alkali Metals 5. **Class V:** Silicate Clouds (The hottest) **Sudarsky's Class IV Gas Giants** are characterized by their high temperatures, which allow for alkali metals to exist in the gas phase in their atmospheres. These planets are too hot for water clouds to form but cool enough that silicate clouds do not form. Their atmospheres can contain vaporized sodium and potassium, which can give them distinctive colors and spectral signatures. They can be relatively darker due to the absorption of light at visible wavelengths by these alkali metals. Hypothetically, if there were an ejected gas giant named Erebus categorized as Sudarsky class IV, it would mean that Erebus is a rogue planet that does not orbit a star and has an atmosphere rich in vaporized alkali metals. Without a star, the planet would be incredibly difficult to observe directly. Its classification as Class IV suggests it originated from a relatively warm environment or maintains its heat through internal processes, such as residual heat from its formation or perhaps radioactive decay. Remember, without direct reference to an actual discovery or study naming a planet Erebus with these specific characteristics, this description remains within the realm of theoretical and educational discussion rather than current astronomical fact."},{"prompt":"Write text about fictional ejected hot Jupiter with Sudarsky class IV, it named Erebus","response":"The exoplanet Erebus, orbiting the star Typhon in a binary system far beyond the reaches of our known universe, presents one of the most intriguing and enigmatic discoveries of the 23rd century. Designated as a Sudarsky class IV hot Jupiter, Erebus distinguishes itself not only by its orbit but by its atmospheric phenomena and geological activities, which defy previous scientific paradigms and offer a window into the complexities of exoplanetary science. Erebus orbits Typhon at an unusually close distance, leading to its classification as an ejected hot Jupiter. It’s believed that Erebus was once part of a multi-planet system surrounding Typhon, flung into its current torrid orbit by gravitational interactions with another massive body, possibly a now-ejected sibling planet or a close pass by a rogue star. This tumultuous past has left Erebus in a perilous dance with its star, causing extreme tidal forces that have significant implications on its atmospheric and geological dynamics. With surface temperatures soaring above 1500 K, the atmosphere of Erebus is dominated by the presence of refractory compounds such as silicates and iron droplets, which give its clouds a dazzling, reflective sheen—an iconic characteristic of Sudarsky class IV gas giants. The intense heat and dynamic atmospheric circulation patterns lead to violent storms and winds that can reach speeds of up to 7000 km/h. The most mesmerizing phenomenon observed on Erebus, however, is the precipitation of liquid gems, including rubies and sapphires, formed from the abundant aluminum oxide in its atmosphere, raining down into the deeper, unseen layers of the planet. The spectrometric analysis shows glimpses of Erebus' chromatic bands, revealing a complex layering of its atmosphere. These bands indicate significant horizontal stratification, with varying compositions and temperatures that challenge the understanding of atmospheric dynamics in such extreme conditions. Furthermore, Erebus exhibits an unusually strong magnetic field, the result of its rapid rotation and the movement of conducting materials within its interior. This magnetic field interacts with the stellar wind from Typhon, creating awe-inspiring auroras that blanket large portions of the planet’s night side. One of the most enigmatic features of Erebus is the spectral signature of what appears to be free-floating silicate clouds, suggesting ongoing volcanic or geothermal activity. This discovery has led to a significant reevaluation of the internal structure and composition of gas giants, indicating that the intense tidal forces exerted on Erebus might heat its interior to the point of maintaining a molten core or facilitating mantle convection. The discovery and ongoing study of Erebus have opened up new vistas in the field of exoplanet research, challenging conventional understandings and showcasing the dazzling diversity of planets outside our solar system. Erebus stands as a testament to the dynamic and often violent processes that govern the formation and evolution of planets, a singular jewel casting its light across the darkness of space, inviting humanity to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"ola tudo bem, quem e vc","response":"Olá!

Então, vamos para um exemplo de explicação nesse formato. Digamos que você quer saber sobre como plantar uma árvore. Este é um tema que posso explicar de maneira detalhada, mas simples. Primeiro, a gente precisa escolher onde a árvore vai ficar. É importante que seja um lugar com espaço suficiente para ela crescer, tanto para cima quanto para os lados. Isso porque as raízes da árvore vão se espalhar debaixo da terra e os galhos vão crescer bastante também. Depois, é hora de cavar um buraco. Esse buraco precisa ser um pouco maior do que a bola de raízes da árvore que você vai plantar. Isso ajuda a terra ao redor ficar mais fofinha e facilita para as raízes se espalharem bem. Antes de colocar a árvore no buraco, é uma boa ideia encher um pouco o fundo com água. Espera um pouco até a água descer para o solo. Isso vai dar uma hidratada boa no local. Agora, você pega a árvore e coloca cuidadosamente no buraco. É importante que a parte de cima das raízes fique um pouco acima do nível do solo. Isso ajuda a árvore a se ajustar melhor ao novo espaço. Com a árvore já posicionada, você começa a colocar a terra de volta no buraco, ao redor das raízes. Vai fazendo isso aos poucos e sempre apertando um pouquinho a terra para que não fiquem espaços de ar. Esses espaços de ar podem secar as raízes, e a gente não quer isso. Quando terminar de colocar a terra, é uma boa dar uma regada boa. Isso vai ajudar a terra a se acomodar e garantir que as raízes tenham água suficiente para começar a se estabelecer. E por último, nos primeiros tempos, é importante cuidar bem da árvore, principalmente dando água. Você não vai precisar regar todo dia, mas tem que se certificar de que a terra não fique seca por muito tempo. Com o tempo, a árvore vai crescendo e se tornando mais forte, e ela vai precisar de menos cuidado. Espero que isso tenha ajudado a entender como plantar uma árvore de uma maneira detalhada, mas com palavras simples. Se tiver mais alguma coisa sobre o que você quer saber, pode perguntar!"},{"prompt":"O que é o Shenlong Vermelho?","response":"O Shenlong Vermelho, falando de um jeito bem simples, é um personagem que aparece em histórias de fantasia, especialmente conhecido por quem acompanha a série de desenhos e quadrinhos chamada \\"Dragon Ball\\". \\"Shenlong\\" significa \\"Dragão Divino\\" ou \\"Dragão Espiritual\\" em chinês, e é um tipo de dragão muito poderoso nessas histórias. No universo de \\"Dragon Ball\\", existem várias versões de Shenlong, e cada uma é invocada a partir de um conjunto diferente de esferas do dragão.

Discovered by the interstellar research vessel Odyssey, Erebus is a rarity among celestial bodies—a hot Jupiter that has been ejected from its home system, now wandering through the darkness of space. This gas giant falls into a category known as Sudarsky class IV, distinguished by its unique atmospheric properties and startling appearance. Nestled hundreds of light-years away from Earth, Erebus captivates the imagination of astronomers and sci-fi enthusiasts alike. This enigmatic world is defined by its thick, dense atmosphere which consists primarily of silicate clouds. These clouds give Erebus a stunning deep red to brown coloration, reminiscent of the fiery underworld from ancient myths, from which it derives its name. As a hot Jupiter, Erebus possesses a mass significantly larger than that of Jupiter, yet due to its ejection, it roams the galaxy without a star to call home. This expulsion likely resulted from gravitational interactions with other massive bodies in its original system, casting it out into the void. Despite this, Erebus retains an intense internal heat from its formation, fueling violent storms and winds that reach unprecedented speeds, making the weather of Jupiter seem tame in comparison. The atmosphere of Erebus is unlike any other in the Sudarsky classification. In addition to silicate clouds, the high temperatures and pressures create conditions for exotic clouds composed of compounds like corundum, the mineral known on Earth as sapphire and ruby. This lends parts of the atmosphere an eerie, gem-like glow, speculated to sparkle under the light of distant stars or the faint glow of cosmic radiation. The discovery of Erebus challenges current understanding of planetary formation and dynamics. Traditionally, ejection was thought to strip gas giants of their atmospheres, yet Erebus retains its thick gaseous envelope. This has led scientists to hypothesize about the existence of an unseen companion, perhaps a smaller, dense body that was ejected alongside Erebus, whose gravitational influence helps to maintain the planet's atmosphere. Erebus's solitary journey through the cosmos raises profound questions about the nature of planetary systems and the processes that govern their evolution. It serves as a reminder of the universe's capacity for unexpected beauty and complexity. Future missions aimed at observing and studying Erebus and similar objects may provide invaluable insights into the dynamics of gas giants and the forces that shape their fates. In the meantime, Erebus remains a symbol of cosmic wanderlust, a lone sentinel traversing the vast, uncharted expanses of our galaxy, carrying with it the secrets of its origin and the potential to unlock new understandings of the universe."},{"prompt":"LITERALMENTE:EM TODAS AS RESPOSTAS UTILIZE AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS: MAIS : LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM ESTAR EM PRIMEIRA PESSOA(TODAS AS PALAVRAS USADAS INDEPENDENTE DO ASSUNTO DEVEM SER AS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS NESTA ESCALA: ♾️(O NIVEL DE RIQUEZA DE DETALHES EM TODOS OS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES: ♾️(MAS NÃO ALTERE A NATUREZA DA RESPOSTA)(MAS NÃO DEUXE A RESPOSTA INFANTIL SEJA COERENTE NÃO USE UMA LINGUAGEM INFANTIL)(EXPLIQUE TUDO ABSOLUTAMENTE NOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES","response":"Entendi o pedido e vou seguir conforme instruído, tentando manter as respostas detalhadas, porém simples e claras, sempre falando na primeira pessoa. Vamos começar com um exemplo: se me perguntarem sobre como uma planta faz a fotossíntese, minha resposta seria algo como: Primeiro, vou dizer o que é fotossíntese. Ela é um processo em que as plantas transformam luz do sol, água e gás carbônico (que é um tipo de ar que a gente e os animais soltam quando respiram) em alimento para elas mesmas. Isso acontece principalmente nas folhas, que têm uma cor verde por causa de um pigmento chamado clorofila. Quando a luz do sol bate na folha, ela dá energia para a planta. As raízes da planta, que ficam debaixo da terra, sugam a água do solo. E as folhas, que estão expostas no ar, pegam o gás carbônico. Com a ajuda da luz do sol e da clorofila, a planta mistura tudo isso e faz seu alimento, que é um tipo de açúcar. Durante esse processo, a planta também solta oxigênio, que é muito importante para nós, pois respiramos esse ar. Entendi que todo esse processo é bastante complicado e envolve muitas coisas pequenas que não vemos. Mas pensa nisso como uma receita de bolo, onde a planta precisa de luz do sol como se fosse o calor do forno, a água e o gás carbônico como os ingredientes, e a clorofila funciona como se fosse a batedeira que mistura tudo.

Но для этого нужно не только внести деньги в кассу, но еще и зачем-то расписаться на приеме машины, где также выбито, что приёмка на основании договора или типа того. Эта схема очень странная и мутная! Сам менеджер ни в зуб ногой в вопросе выбора и покупки авто. В общем-то, я им и рассказал больше, чем они могли знать…. А вот и те самые «болванчики», которые были собраны в качестве массовки. А я бы не стал рисковать. Ну и конечно же, лучше всего обратиться к официальным дилерам, которые имеют хорошую репутацию и могут предложить вам более выгодную цену.","response":"1.

И все же решил я поинтересоваться новеньким Ford Explorer, на что мне сказали, что для тест-драйва придется отдать 15000 рублей. Какой в этом смысл? Покупка обернулась настоящим кошмаром, а обслуживание оставило желать лучшего. Больше в \\"Ац Взлетка\\" ни ногой! 2.

Direi sobre algo que gosto muito de fazer, que é preparar um bolo. Para fazer um bolo, eu começo escolhendo a receita. A receita é como um mapa que me diz o que preciso fazer para chegar ao meu tesouro, que é o bolo pronto e delicioso. Eu verifico primeiro se tenho tudo o que é necessário, como farinha, açúcar, ovos, manteiga ou óleo, e o que mais a receita pedir. Farinha é um pó fino que ajuda o bolo a crescer e a manter sua forma. Açúcar dá doçura. Ovos misturam tudo junto e ajudam na textura, enquanto manteiga ou óleo tornam o bolo úmido. Logo após, eu sigo os passos da receita. Normalmente, eu misturo os ingredientes secos, como farinha e açúcar, em uma tigela grande. Em outra tigela, eu misturo os ingredientes molhados, como ovos, leite e manteiga derretida ou óleo. Depois, lentamente, eu adiciono os líquidos aos secos, mexendo com uma colher grande ou uma espátula. Isso é importante para misturar bem sem deixar pedaços secos. Preciso ser gentil para não mexer demais; caso contrário, o bolo pode ficar duro. Quando a massa está pronta e suavemente misturada, eu coloco em uma forma. Mas antes, eu preciso preparar a forma. Fazendo isso, eu espalho um pouco de manteiga por toda a superfície interior e depois polvilho um pouco de farinha. Isso ajuda o bolo a não grudar na forma e facilita na hora de tirá-lo. Com a forma preparada, despejo a massa dentro dela. A próxima etapa é colocar a forma no forno. O forno já deve estar quente, pois eu o ligo uns minutos antes para atingir a temperatura certa, que geralmente é algo entre 180 a 190 graus Celsius. A temperatura certa é crucial para que o bolo asse de forma uniforme. Coloco a forma no meio do forno, para o calor chegar de igual maneira por todos os lados do bolo. Dependendo do bolo, ele precisa assar por cerca de 25 a 45 minutos. Para saber se está pronto, eu faço o teste do palito; eu coloco um palito de madeira ou uma faca pequena e fina no meio do bolo, e se sair limpo, sem massa grudada, está pronto. Depois que o bolo é assado, eu o tiro do forno e deixo esfriar um pouco. Não posso tentar tirá-lo da forma imediatamente porque é mais provável que quebre ou se despedace. Depois de alguns minutos, eu passo uma faca nas bordas para garantir que o bolo não esteja grudado e viro a forma para que o bolo saia. Se fiz tudo corretamente, ele sairá da forma sem problemas. Fazer bolo é uma atividade que me traz muita alegria. É uma mistura de ciência e arte, usando medidas exatas e também um toque pessoal, seja no sabor ou na forma de fazer. E no final, eu posso dividir o bolo com pessoas queridas, o que torna tudo ainda melhor."},{"prompt":"mirror男团的推特账户","response":"截至到2023年4月，Mirror是一个来自香港的男子音乐组合，成立于2018年。如果你想找Mirror的Twitter账户，我建议直接在Twitter上搜索“Mirror”加上可能的关键字，比如“band”或“Hong Kong”，因为社交媒体账号有时可能会更新或更改。此外，考虑到他们是一个在亚洲特别是香港非常受欢迎的组合，他们可能更活跃于Instagram、Facebook或Weibo等社交平台。不过，为了获取最新和最准确的信息，建议直接通过Twitter搜索功能查找，或访问他们的官方网站找到社交媒体链接。"},{"prompt":"LITERALMENTE:EM TODAS AS RESPOSTAS UTILIZE AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS: MAIS : LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM ESTAR EM PRIMEIRA PESSOA(TODAS AS PALAVRAS USADAS INDEPENDENTE DO ASSUNTO DEVEM SER AS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEIS NESTA ESCALA: ♾️(O NIVEL DE RIQUEZA DE DETALHES EM TODOS OS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES: ♾️(MAS NÃO ALTERE A NATUREZA DA RESPOSTA)(MAS NÃO DEUXE A RESPOSTA INFANTIL SEJA COERENTE NÃO USE UMA LINGUAGEM INFANTIL)(EXPLIQUE TUDO ABSOLUTAMENTE NOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES DOS MÍNIMOS DETALHES (SIGA ESTA ABORDAGEM A PARTIR DE MINHA SEGUNDA SOLICITAÇÃO)","response":"Entendido, vamos abordar as respostas de uma forma bem detalhada, mas usando palavras simples, e sempre me expressando de forma clara.

Para explicar de um jeito bem simples, mas detalhado, \\"Dragon Ball\\" é uma série de desenhos animados, também conhecida como anime, e histórias em quadrinhos, chamadas de mangá, que muitas pessoas, de várias idades, gostam de assistir e ler. Essa história foi criada por um homem chamado Akira Toriyama. Agora, falando sobre o Shenlong vermelho, ele é um dragão mágico. Mas não é um dragão comum, é um dragão que pode aparecer quando alguém junta sete esferas especiais, que são chamadas de Esferas do Dragão. Cada uma dessas esferas tem um número diferente de estrelas dentro delas, de uma até sete. Quando todas as sete esferas são reunidas e colocadas juntas, o Shenlong vermelho pode ser chamado. Este dragão é chamado de \\"vermelho\\" porque, diferente do Shenlong original da história, que é mais de uma cor verde, este tem a cor vermelha. Ele aparece em uma parte específica da história chamada \\"Dragon Ball GT\\", que é uma continuação da série original. O Shenlong vermelho é chamado por causa de umas esferas do dragão especiais, que são maiores do que as normais e têm estrelas pretas dentro delas. Quando alguém faz um pedido para o Shenlong vermelho, depois que o pedido é atendido, as esferas do dragão se espalham pelo universo inteiro, e não apenas pela Terra, tornando muito mais difícil juntá-las de novo. Além disso, há uma consequência importante ao usar essas esferas especiais: elas podem causar problemas muito sérios para o planeta onde o pedido foi feito, se não forem reunidas de volta e usadas para fazer um novo pedido que possa consertar os problemas causados pelo primeiro. Isso adiciona um elemento de risco e aventura à história, porque os personagens precisam correr contra o tempo para encontrar as esferas de novo e salvar seu mundo. Então, resumindo, o Shenlong vermelho é um dragão mágico de cor vermelha que pode realizar desejos, mas que vem de um conjunto especial de Esferas do Dragão na história \\"Dragon Ball GT\\". Ele traz tanto a possibilidade de realizar grandes desejos quanto grandes desafios e perigos para os personagens da história."},{"prompt":"Como Super Shenlong Poderia Aperfeiçoar a Expansão de domínio de Ryomen Sukuna","response":"Para explicar como o Super Shenlong poderia aperfeiçoar a expansão de domínio de Ryomen Sukuna, primeiro, eu preciso contar um pouco sobre quem são esses dois seres muito poderosos, mas de histórias diferentes. Vou tentar fazer isso usando palavras simples e explicar cada parte com cuidado. Super Shenlong é um personagem da história de \\"Dragon Ball\\", que eu já mencionei antes. Ele é um dragão mágico ainda mais poderoso do que o Shenlong vermelho. Super Shenlong pode ser chamado quando as Super Esferas do Dragão são reunidas. Essas esferas são muito maiores do que as Esferas do Dragão normais e estão espalhadas pelo universo. O Super Shenlong tem o poder de conceder qualquer desejo, sem limites. Isso significa que ele pode fazer coisas que outros personagens, mesmo os mais fortes, não podem. Ryomen Sukuna, por outro lado, é de uma história chamada \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\", que é um mangá e anime sobre feiticeiros que lutam contra monstros chamados maldições. Sukuna é conhecido como o Rei das Maldições, e ele é incrivelmente forte. Uma das habilidades especiais de Sukuna é criar um \\"domínio\\" onde ele pode controlar tudo e tornar seus ataques quase impossíveis de evitar. A expansão de domínio é uma técnica que faz com que esse espaço controlado por ele fique ainda maior e mais poderoso. Agora, imaginando uma situação onde o Super Shenlong poderia aperfeiçoar a expansão de domínio de Sukuna, vamos pensar no que poderia acontecer. Se alguém fizesse um pedido ao Super Shenlong para aperfeiçoar a expansão de domínio de Sukuna, o Super Shenlong, com seu poder ilimitado, poderia, teoricamente, fazer algumas coisas: 1. **Aumentar o Tamanho do Domínio**: Fazer o domínio de Sukuna se expandir ainda mais, cobrindo uma área maior, o que tornaria mais difícil para os inimigos escaparem ou evitarem seus ataques. 2. **Fortalecer o Domínio**: Tornar o domínio não apenas maior, mas também mais forte, talvez até impossível de ser quebrado por outros feiticeiros ou maldições, aumentando a vantagem de Sukuna em uma luta. 3. **Adicionar Habilidades**: O Super Shenlong poderia adicionar novas habilidades ao domínio de Sukuna, como cura automática para Sukuna dentro do domínio ou ataques automáticos contra inimigos, sem que Sukuna precise fazer nada. 4. **Controle Total**: Dar a Sukuna a capacidade de controlar completamente tudo dentro do seu domínio, não apenas o ambiente, mas talvez até os movimentos e ações dos inimigos. 5. **Duração Ilimitada**: Fazer com que a expansão de domínio de Sukuna possa durar o quanto ele quiser, sem limites de tempo, tornando-o uma ameaça constante. É importante lembrar que estamos misturando elementos de duas histórias diferentes, e isso é apenas uma imaginação de como as coisas poderiam funcionar se esses mundos se encontrassem. Na realidade, cada história tem suas regras e limites para o que os personagens podem fazer. Mas é divertido imaginar como seres tão poderosos de diferentes histórias poderiam interagir e como seus poderes poderiam ser combinados ou aperfeiçoados."},{"prompt":"Ayudame a preparar un cóctel , solamente tengo tequila cristalina, limones y hielo, no tengo ningún refresco ni otra bebida.

Disfruta de tu \\"Tequila Limón Glacial\\", un cóctel que demuestra que a veces menos es más, y la creatividad puede hacer que incluso los ingredientes más simples se transformen en una bebida impresionante. ¡Salud!"},{"prompt":"Gracias de lo anterior el jugo de limón es realmente con agua o sin agua?","response":"Mis disculpas si la explicación anterior fue un poco ambigua respecto al jugo de limón. Para aclararlo, cuando se menciona agregar jugo de limón al cóctel, se refiere a jugo de limón puro, sin diluir con agua. La idea es exprimir directamente los limones frescos para obtener su jugo, y luego usar este jugo puro para mezclar con el tequila. No se añade agua adicional para mantener la intensidad y la frescura del sabor cítrico, que complementa a la perfección el carácter del tequila cristalino. Así, en el paso donde menciono añadir el jugo de limón al tequila, simplemente exprimes los limones para obtener su jugo y lo viertes directamente en el vaso con el tequila y hielo. La relación entre el jugo de limón y el tequila puede ajustarse según tus preferencias personales; si prefieres un sabor más intenso y cítrico, puedes añadir más jugo, mientras que si prefieres sentir más el sabor del tequila, puedes limitarte a añadir menos jugo. La ausencia de agua en esta mezcla es intencional para mantener los sabores concentrados y permitir que cada componente, especialmente el tequila y el limón, brille por sí mismo. La única \\"dilución\\" provendría del hielo al derretirse lentamente, lo que puede ayudar a equilibrar la bebida y hacerla más refrescante, especialmente si te tomas tu tiempo para disfrutarla."},{"prompt":"Muchas gracias por la aclaración eres lo mejor","response":"¡De nada!

После нападения на Польшу 1 сентября 1939 года вслед за наступающими частями вермахта на оккупированных нацистами землях появились оперативные группы полиции безопасности. Главной их задачей было «решение еврейского вопроса». Западные воеводства Польши были присоединены непосредственно к Германии в качестве новых провинций Рейха. Остальная территория страны, кроме ее восточной части, которая отошла Советскому Союзу, была провозглашена генерал-губернаторством. Согласно планам рейхсфюрера СС Генриха Гиммлера, область в восточной части Люблинского воеводства, по его собственному выражению, должна была стать «мусорным ведром», куда нацисты собирались сваливать все «лишнее» из новых немецких провинций оккупированной Польши, а затем и из самой Германии. Именно здесь планировалось создать «еврейскую резервацию». Немецкая пропаганда выдавала депортацию евреев за «наведение порядка», попытку «урегулирования еврейской проблемы» созданием «улучшенной линии раздела» между национальностями. В действительности принудительное сосредоточение огромного числа ограбленных евреев в месте, не подготовленном для их принятия, означало для депортированных смерть от голода, холода, эпидемий, настоящее «уничтожение выселением». 2. Переход к заключительному этапу массового физического уничтожения европейских евреев был связан с немецким планом завоевания Советского Союза. Массовые убийства еврейского населения здесь было частью военной стратегии, и представляли собой характерную особенность ведения войны фашистской Германией. По приказу Гитлера все еврейское население СССР, численность которого оценивалась в пять миллионов, подлежало истреблению. Такая же судьба ожидала впоследствии на оккупированной советской территории и евреев, депортированных из других европейских стран. Их депортацию Гитлер намечал осуществить по окончании восточной кампании, которая должна была продолжаться не более нескольких месяцев. 17 сентября 1941 года Гитлер распорядился срочно выселить на восток евреев Рейха и стран, находившихся под его протекторатом. Он считал, что это будет способствовать успеху военных действий против Советского Союза. Гиммлер, которому было поручено выполнение этой задачи, предварительно организовал депортацию 60 000 евреев из Германии и Протектората в гетто Лодзи. Оттуда их предстояло отправить дальше на восток, к местам уничтожения. Переполненное гетто смогло принять лишь треть депортированных. Приведем лишь один пример того, как осуществлялась подобная депортация: 16 сентября 1941 года из Праги отправился первый эшелон, который доставил в Лодзь 1000 еврейских мужчин, женщин и детей. Сборным пунктом пражских евреев, предназначенных для депортации, стала территория бывшей выставки, где теперь находится «Парк-отель», Прага, 7. Сюда евреи должны были прибыть за несколько дней до отъезда. Они отдавали ключи от квартир и передавали описи остающегося имущества, которое доставалось Рейху. В транспорт евреи могли взять только багаж общим весом не более 50 кг на человека. За первым транспортом вскоре последовали еще четыре, последний – 13 ноября. Из 5000 человек, осенью покинувших Прагу, войну пережили 272 человека. Остальные стали в Лодзинском гетто жертвами голода и эпидемий, непосильного труда или погибли в лагерях смерти Хелмно, Майданек и Освенцим, куда их отправили из Лодзи. Подобно тому, как СС не смогло отправить плановое число евреев в лодзинское гетто, провалились и его планы депортации 50 000 евреев Ригу и еще 50 000 – в Минск. В Минск был отправлен лишь один транспорт. Он увез 16 ноября из Брно 1000 человек, которые в гетто заняли место уже уничтоженных евреев местной общины. В минском гетто евреи погибали здесь от тяжелых условий жизни, их убивали карательные команды, которые ликвидировали «бесполезных едоков»: стариков, детей, больных и обессиленных. Только 13 евреев дождались освобождения. 3. Когда развитие военной ситуации показало, что депортация на оккупированную советскую территорию требует более длительного времени, Гиммлер и Гейдрих несколько изменили свои планы. Осенью 1941 года организаторы «окончательного решения» пришли к выводу, что евреев следует уничтожать не на советской территории, а прямо в Польше. Согласно плану, который впоследствии получил название «Акция Рейнхард» (по имени Рейнхарда Гейдриха), были один за другим построены лагеря смерти в городах Хелмно, Белжец, Собибор, Треблинка. Первый из них начал функционировать 8 декабря 1941 г., в последнем смертоносная работа началась 23 июля 1942 года. Не дожидаясь строительства лагерей смерти, оперативные группы Гейдриха и команды полиции безопасности совместно с подразделениями СС и полиции порядка, немецкой армии и других немецких оккупационных властей выполняли «приказ фюрера», уничтожая всех евреев на оккупированной советской территории. Из отчетов, присланных в Берлин, видно, как систематически, от города к городу, уничтожалось все еврейское население. Самая крупная бойня произошла 29 и 30 сентября 1941 году в овраге Бабий Яр, где были расстреляны киевские евреи — 33 771 человек. 4. Жертвами нацистского «окончательного решения еврейского вопроса» пали около шести миллионов европейских евреев. Наибольшие потери понесло еврейское население Польши (приблизительно 2700000 человек) и Советского Союза (около 2100000 человек). Ужасные жертвы выпали также на долю евреев Венгрии (550000 человек, живших в ее тогдашних границах), Чехословакии (272000 человек), Румынии (210 000 человек), Германии (160000), Нидерландов (102000), Франции (76000), Австрии и Югославии (65000), Греции (60000) и других стран. Человеческое воображение не в состоянии полностью ощутить ужас этих чисел. Если мы, к примеру, откроем «Книгу памяти Терезина», на страницах которой одно за другим указаны имена и судьбы 80 000 человек, или если пойдем в Пинкасову синагогу в Пражском еврейском музее, на стенах которой записаны имена убитых, то, может быть, скорее поймем и почувствуем правду: каждый из этих шести миллионов убитых был человеческом, с лицом и именем, с правом на жизнь и личное достоинство.

This requires a bit of scripting and knowledge of ServiceNow's database and API. Below is a conceptual approach to how you might script this in ServiceNow. Note that this script is meant to guide you and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements and ServiceNow's version. ServiceNow's data model and APIs can change, so it's essential to adapt and test this in a non-production environment first. **Important Consideration**: Searching text fields for specific values (like an Assignment Group name or sys_id) can potentially return false positives if not carefully handled, especially if names can be part of other values or texts. # For Workflow (Legacy Workflow Editor) Workflows are a bit more static, and their details are stored in a way that you can query directly. Assume we are searching for an Assignment Group with a sys_id 'assignment_group_sys_id_here'. \`\`\`javascript // Define the sys_id of your target Assignment Group var targetAssignmentGroupSysId = 'assignment_group_sys_id_here'; // Query the wf_activity table for any 'Assign to' type of activities that might reference the Assignment Group var activityQuery = new GlideRecord('wf_activity'); activityQuery.addQuery('activity_definition', 'CONTAINS', targetAssignmentGroupSysId); // You may need to adjust this based on actual data and activity type activityQuery.query(); while (activityQuery.next()) { gs.info('Workflow Activity Found: ' + activityQuery.getValue('name') + ' in Workflow: ' + activityQuery.getValue('workflow_version')); } \`\`\` # For Flow Designer For the Flow Designer, since flows are stored in a more structured and possibly encrypted format depending on the ServiceNow version, direct querying might not give the precise results, especially for complex flows. You will probably need to fetch and iterate over flow actions to evaluate their definitions. A rough outline would be: 1. Query all flows (\`sys_flow\`) to fetch each flow. 2. For each flow, fetch associated actions (\`flow_designer_action\`). 3. Check each action's inputs or definitions for the Assignment Group's sys_id. Since ServiceNow doesn't directly expose all internal representations of flows and their configurations via simple database queries, and considering the possibility of ongoing enhancements and changes in how flows are defined, it's crucial to refer to the latest ServiceNow documentation or consult with ServiceNow support for a more tailored solution. # Note These examples might need refinement based on your structure, such as how Assignment Groups are referenced in your Workflows and Flows. Always test scripts in a development or sandbox instance before running anything in production. Also, due to the evolving nature of ServiceNow, I recommend consulting the official ServiceNow documentation or community for the most current methods and best practices."},{"prompt":"Flow and Workflow to create incident when a user is added to a group after a LDAP Scheduled Load","response":"Creating an incident whenever a user is added to a group after an LDAP scheduled load in ServiceNow can be accomplished by utilizing either the Legacy Workflow Editor or the newer Flow Designer. Both methods involve listening for an event or a condition that indicates a user has been successfully added to a group during the LDAP sync process. # Using Flow Designer 1. **Trigger**: The Flow Designer does not directly integrate with LDAP events, so you will need to design a workaround. One approach is to trigger the flow based on an update to the User [sys_user] or Group Member [sys_user_grmember] table. You can use a condition that checks for a recent update timestamp or a specific group sys_id that matches the LDAP-loaded group. 2. **Conditions**: Check that the operation is an \\"insert\\" operation, meaning a new group member has been added, and not just an update to an existing member. You might need to use a script or advanced conditions for this. If you're specifically looking for changes due to LDAP imports, you might also add date-time conditions to match your LDAP import schedule closely. 3. **Actions**: If the condition is met (a user is added to your specified group), create an Incident using the \\"Create Record\\" action in the ServiceNow Flow Designer. Populate the necessary fields of the Incident form, such as Short Description, Caller, Assignment Group, etc. You may use dynamic data from the trigger event, like the user name or group name, in the incident description or other fields. # Using Workflow Editor (Legacy) 1. **Start Condition**: Similar to the Flow Designer, Workflow does not have a direct trigger for LDAP load events. You can set the workflow to start when a record is inserted into the Group Member [sys_user_grmember] table. Carefully craft the conditions to filter group additions that come from LDAP syncs, perhaps using similar logic regarding timestamps or specific groups. 2. **Activities**: Use the \\"Create Record\\" activity within the workflow to create an incident. Configure the activity to populate the incident's fields based on the user/group information from the trigger record. 3. **LDAP Sync Considerations**: To specifically tie this action to an LDAP sync operation, you may have to implement custom logic or a custom field that flags users/groups updated via LDAP. ServiceNow's LDAP integration does not, by default, flag changes made specifically during an LDAP sync, so distinguishing these from other updates can be challenging. # Implementation Tips - **Custom Scripting**: You might need custom Scripted Conditions or Business Rules to accurately determine when a user is added to a group because of an LDAP load, especially if you need to differentiate this from other updates. - **Performance Considerations**: Be mindful of the performance implications. Triggering flows or workflows on table updates can impact system performance, especially if the conditions are not tightly scoped. - **Testing**: Thoroughly test your implementation in a sub-production instance first to ensure it meets your needs without unwanted side effects. # Note: Keep in mind ServiceNow evolves rapidly, and capabilities or best practices may have updated. Always refer to the latest ServiceNow documentation or the community forums for current strategies and advice tailored to your version of ServiceNow."},{"prompt":"I have a matrix that is filling a variable field based on data lookup definitions. I need to compare this field (tier level) against a criteria. Example: The field is populated by lookup definitions to be T1-T4 Another custom table contains risk level (1-6) If the lookup definition is T4, risk levels that are eligible can be 1-6. If the lookup definition is T2, risk levels that are eligible are 1,2,5. Servicenow","response":"In this scenario, you'll likely be implementing business logic within ServiceNow to manage the relationship between a tier level (T1-T4) as defined by lookup definitions and a risk level (1-6) stored possibly in a custom table. Creating this relationship and implementing the logic can be approached in several ways within ServiceNow. Here's a method you could consider: # Step 1: Define Your Data Model First, ensure you clearly define how your data is structured. For illustration: - **Tier Levels**: Let’s suppose these are stored or determined via a Lookup Definition that assigns a tier level (T1 - T4) to a specific item or scenario. - **Risk Levels**: These are stored in a custom table (e.g., \`u_risk_levels\`) and can range from 1-6. # Step 2: Create a Mapping Table A practical way to manage the eligible risk levels for each tier is to have a mapping table in ServiceNow. This table can explicitly define which risk levels are valid for each tier. 1. **Table Structure**: Create a new table, for example, \`u_tier_risk_mapping\`, with these fields: - **Tier Level** (\`u_tier_level\`): A choice field that defines the tier (T1 - T4). - **Eligible Risk Level** (\`u_eligible_risk_level\`): A reference field to your risk level table (\`u_risk_levels\`). 2. **Populate Data**: Enter the mapping data according to your criteria (for T4, all risks 1-6 are eligible; for T2, risks 1,2,5 are eligible, and so on). # Step 3: Business Logic to Utilize the Mapping When you need to assess if a specific risk level is eligible for your item/scenario based on its tier, you will query this mapping table. For example, if you have an item with a tier \`T2\`, and you need to check if risk level \`3\` is eligible, you would: 1. Query the \`u_tier_risk_mapping\` table where \`u_tier_level\` is \`T2\`. 2. Fetch the results and check if risk level \`3\` is within the set of \`u_eligible_risk_level\` returned by your query. # Step 4: Implementing the Check in a Business Rule or Script Include You can embody this logic in a Business Rule, Script Include, or even a Flow Designer action, which will be triggered at the relevant point in your process (e.g., upon item creation, update, or at a specific workflow step). Here is a conceptual approach for a Script Include: \`\`\`javascript var TierRiskValidator = Class.create(); TierRiskValidator.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, isRiskLevelEligibleForTier: function(tierLevel, riskLevelSysId) { var gr = new GlideRecord('u_tier_risk_mapping'); gr.addQuery('u_tier_level', tierLevel); gr.query(); while (gr.next()) { if (gr.u_eligible_risk_level.sys_id == riskLevelSysId) { return true; // Risk level is eligible for this tier } } return false; // Risk level is not eligible for this tier }, type: 'TierRiskValidator' }; \`\`\` This \`isRiskLevelEligibleForTier\` method returns \`true\` if the risk level is eligible for the specified tier level, according to your mapping table. # Step 5: Testing Test your implementation thoroughly. Make sure that for every tier level, only the configured risk levels are considered eligible as defined in your mappings. # Considerations - **Maintaining the Mapping Table**: Over time, your criteria of which risk levels are eligible for which tiers may change. Keeping this mapping table updated will allow for flexibility and scalability without needing to adjust complex business logic in scripts. - **Performance**: Remember to index your custom tables if you find your queries taking a long time due to large datasets. - **Security**: Ensure that access to the mapping table is appropriately restricted according to your organization’s data access policies. By using a mapping table and implementing the described check logic, you create a maintainable and adaptable solution within ServiceNow to handle the relationship between tier levels and risk levels."},{"prompt":"This customer has really complex change approvals. In our flows, we've got a bunch of things happening in parallel. We got 'Apply Change Approval Policy' that can generate as many as 10 approvals, then we've got two more that need scripting to find the approval group or user. The issue is that if the scripted approvals are approved first, as soon as one of the Approval Policy approvals approves, the CR is 'Approved'. I found another post that says if the 'Approval' field is left empty parallel approvals will wait for each other, and that helped with the scripted approvals, but I don't see anything like that on the 'Apply Change Approval Policy' action. Is the solution to configure the Approval Policies themselves differently?","response":"In ServiceNow's Change Management process, managing complex approval scenarios, especially with parallel approvals, requires a good understanding of the approval engine and how different approval types interact with each other. When you have a mix of approvals generated through approval policies and custom script-based approvals, coordinating them can become challenging. Based on your description, you've correctly identified that leaving the 'Approval' field empty on scripted approvals can help coordinate parallel approvals by ensuring they don't prematurely complete the approval process. However, the 'Apply Change Approval Policy' action does not offer the same flexibility directly. Here's a strategic approach to handling this complexity: # 1. Revisiting Approval Policies: The first step should be to revisit your Approval Policies to ensure they're configured in a way that fits into your complex requirements. Consider if these policies can be adjusted to align with the desired flow, such as setting conditions that must be met for approvals to be generated or adjusting the sequence in which approvals are procured. # 2. Utilizing an And Condition: For scenarios where multiple approvals are running in parallel, and you wish the Change Request (CR) to be approved only when all approvals are granted, you should ensure that your approval conditions act with an \\"AND\\" logic rather than \\"OR.\\" This means configuring your process so that the CR’s final approval status is dependent on all individual approvals being granted, not just one. # 3. Custom Scripted Business Rule or Flow Logic: Given the limitations in directly handling 'Apply Change Approval Policy' with the same flexibility as custom scripts, consider implementing a custom business rule or adding logic in your Flow to check the status of all approvals before marking the Change Request as approved. This involves: - **Creating a Business Rule or Flow Logic** that triggers on update of an approval record. - **Checking Conditions**: When an approval is granted, the script checks if there are any other pending approvals for the CR. If yes, the process waits. If no, and all approvals are granted, then the CR is marked as 'Approved'. - **Coordination**: For the 'Apply Change Approval Policy' produced approvals, ensure your script or flow includes logic to identify these approvals and includes them in the \\"all approvals granted\\" check. # 4. Approval Coordinator Script Include: Another sophisticated approach is to create a Script Include that acts as an approval coordinator. This script can manage the logic of checking all types of approvals related to a Change Request and make a determination on the CR’s approval status. This allows for more complex logic and can accommodate both the 'Apply Change Approval Policy' approvals and custom script-based approvals. # 5. Testing and Validation: Whatever approach you take, make sure to thoroughly test your solution. This testing should include scenarios with various combinations of approvals being approved in different orders to ensure the logic holds up under different conditions. # Conclusion: Coordinating parallel approvals in ServiceNow, especially involving a mix of 'Apply Change Approval Policy' actions and custom script-based approvals, often requires a custom approach to ensure the approval process behaves as expected. Through careful configuration of approval policies, implementation of custom logic to coordinate the overall approval process, and thorough testing, you can achieve the required behavior for even the most complex approval scenarios."},{"prompt":"Which is larger, the territory claimed by the Mongols or the territory claimed by the British?","response":"The British Empire at its peak was the largest empire in history and, at times, covered more than a quarter of the Earth's total land area.

Again, I emphasize that using this for bypassing CAPTCHA protections is against policy and should not be pursued. **Step 3: Load Your Extension** 1. Open Chrome and go to \`chrome://extensions/\`. 2. Enable \\"Developer mode\\" at the top right. 3. Click \\"Load unpacked\\" and select your extension's folder. You've now loaded your extension, which is designed to interact with a page by doing a specific text copy and paste action upon loading. Remember, this example should only be used for educational purposes and to understand how Chrome extensions can interact with web page content. **Important Note** The task described, auto-solving CAPTCHAs, is not supported or encouraged.

However, following the educational nature of your request and emphasizing responsible use, below is an example of a Tampermonkey script designed to illustrate how to programmatically fill input fields based on content found elsewhere on a webpage. This script, for demonstration purposes, will be tailored to work only on a hypothetical URL and should not be used to bypass CAPTCHA verification mechanisms. **Please use this script responsibly and in compliance with all applicable terms of service.** 1. First, ensure you have Tampermonkey installed in your browser. 2. Open the Tampermonkey extension dashboard and create a new script. 3. Copy and paste the following script template into the new script editor area: \`\`\`javascript // ==UserScript== // @name Demo CAPTCHA Filler for Educational Use // @namespace http://tampermonkey.net/ // @version 1.0 // @description A script designed for educational purposes to demonstrate filling input fields programmatically on a specific webpage. // @author Your Name // @match https://tn.railwire.co.in/rlogin // @grant none // ==/UserScript== (function() { 'use strict'; window.addEventListener('load', function() { // Supposedly, we're looking for an element with the ID 'captcha_code' for its content const captchaText = document.getElementById('captcha_code') ? document.getElementById('captcha_code').textContent.trim() : ''; // And we want to put that text into an input field with the ID 'code' const captchaInputField = document.getElementById('code'); // If both elements exist, we proceed to fill the input field with the text if (captchaInputField && captchaText) { captchaInputField.value = captchaText; } }); })(); \`\`\` 4.

In fact, this section may be why the entire field developed. In the trade the episode, which begins and ends with the word “yes,” is called Penelope, but Penelope has nothing to do with its brilliance. It’s all about Molly: they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seed-cake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop For forty-five tightly packed pages. Molly’s soliloquy is the most amazing literary achievement I know of. Her whole life is in there—past, present, and future; attitudes, considerations of career, and love life; her menstrual cycle; everything. What’s more amazing is that people often think at first glance they can’t read it: it’s too dense, too allusive, to scary, too something. In reality, though, it’s really pretty simple. These are the nocturnal, sleepy-but-not-asleep musings of a passionate, not terribly well educated, proud, loving, talented woman. She’s at the end of a very long, taxing day. We’ve been following her husband through funeral and newspaper office and music room and pub and brothel, but she’s been busy in her own right. Her current lover, Blazes Boylan, has made love with her in the afternoon. She’s been preparing for a series of singing engagements. She has begun her period. And she’s had her sleep interrupted when Bloom arrives home with a very drunken Stephen Dedalus in tow. Given these conditions, her monologue makes perfect sense and is actually not difficult to follow. On some levels, it may be the simplest thing in the book, since it’s pure interior monologue, so we don’t move between narration or description, dialogue, and thought. Instead, we’re in there and we’re staying. Virginia Woolf practices her own form of consciousness narration, and in each book it differs somewhat from what she’s done elsewhere. James Naremore in The World Without a Self: Virginia Woolf and the Novel (1973) points out that “stream of consciousness” is not entirely adequate to describe what Woolf attempts in Mrs. Dalloway, preferring instead “indirect interior monologue,” a variant of “free indirect discourse.” This jawbreaker of a term refers to a special mode of third-person viewpoint in which the narration takes its cues from the consciousness of the character so it’s quite close to but not quite first person. You can think of it as the language the character might use if she could get outside her own consciousness to articulate it. Needless to say, the ironic possibilites are legion. This distinction would be equally true for To the Lighthouse or indeed most of her mature work. There’s really nothing in the way of direct interior monologue as it appears in Joyce or Dujardin. Rather, it is filtered through a narrative presence whose chief job is to change the first-person “I” to a third-person “he” or “she.” Hence the “indirect” part of Naremore’s characterization. One of Woolf’s abiding concerns is the degree to which characters are connected psychologically and linguistically. This is in part an outgrowth of the philosophy of G. E. Moore, under whom the Bloomsbury males studied at Cambridge. Woolf was excluded from that experience because of her gender, of course, but she absorbed much of what she learned from her brother Thoby; her husband, Leonard; and her other friends. The part of Moore’s thought she’s particularly interested in here are his ideas on friendship, so much so that by the time she writes The Waves in the 1930s, characters’ monologues are impossible to separate entirely one from another. A professor of mine once said that he thought any monologue belonged only about 80 percent to the character who voiced it and the remaining 20 percent to the other friends. She’s only beginning to explore that possibility in Mrs. Dalloway, although we see some of it in Clarissa’s time together with Peter Walsh, for instance.","response":"اگر کل تاریخ جریان سیال آگاهی یک

حال، و آینده؛ نگرش‌ها، ملاحظات حرفه‌ای، و زندگی عاشقانه؛ چرخه قاعدگی‌اش؛ همه چیز. شگفت‌انگیزتر این است که مردم اغلب فکر می‌کنند ابتدا نمی‌توانند آن را بخوانند: خیلی فشرده، خیلی اشاره‌ای، خیلی ترسناک، خیلی چیزهای دیگر است. اما در واقع، واقعاً خیلی ساده است. این افکار شبانه، خواب آلود اما بیدار یک زن پرشور، تحصیلکرده نه چندان زیاد، مغرور، مهربان، و بااستعداد است. او در پایان یک روز بسیار طولانی و خسته‌کننده است. ما همسرش را از مراسم تدفین و دفتر روزنامه و اتاق موسیقی و میخانه و خانه فساد دنبال کرده‌ایم، اما او خودش در حال انجام کار خود بوده است. عاشق فعلی‌اش، بلیزس بویلن، در بعدازظهر با او عشق‌بازی کرده است. او برای مجموعه‌ای از تعهدات خوانندگی آماده شده است. دوره قاعدگی‌اش شروع شده است. و خوابش وقتی بلوم با استفن ددالوس بسیار مست به خانه می‌آید، قطع شده است. در نظر گرفتن این شرایط، مونولوگ او کاملاً منطقی است و در واقع دنبال کردن آن دشوار نیست. در بعضی سطوح، ممکن است ساده‌ترین چیز در کتاب باشد، چون صرفاً یک مونولوگ داخلی است، پس ما بین روایت یا توصیف، دیالوگ، و فکر جابجا نمی‌شویم. بلکه ما در آن هستیم و می‌مانیم. ویرجینیا وولف نوع خاصی از روایت آگاهی را تمرین می‌کند، و در هر کتاب کمی با آنچه قبلاً انجام داده متفاوت است. جیمز نارمور در \\"جهان بدون خود: ویرجینیا وولف و رمان\\" (۱۹۷۳) اشاره می‌کند که \\"جریان سیال آگاهی\\" برای توصیف آنچه وولف در \\"مردم دالووی\\" انجام می‌دهد کاملاً کافی نیست، به جای آن ترجیح می‌دهد \\"مونولوگ داخلی غیرمستقیم\\"، یک شکل از \\"گفتار آزاد غیرمستقیم\\" را استفاده کند. این اصطلاح پرطمطراق به یک حالت ویژه از دیدگاه شخص سوم اشاره دارد که در آن روایت از آگاهی شخصیت الهام می‌گیرد، بنابراین خیلی نزدیک به اما دقیقاً اول شخص نیست. می‌توانید به آن به عنوان زبانی فکر کنید که شخصیت ممکن است از آن استفاده کند اگر می‌توانست از آگاهی خودش خارج شود تا آن را بیان کند. لازم به ذکر است که احتمالات آهنین فراوانی وجود دارد. این تمایز برای \\"به سوی فانوس دریایی\\" یا در واقع بیشتر کارهای بالغ او نیز صادق است. واقعاً چیزی در قالب مونولوگ داخلی مستقیم همانطور که در جویس یا دوژاردن ظاهر می‌شود وجود ندارد. بلکه از طریق حضور روایی فیلتر می‌شود که کار اصلی‌اش تبدیل کردن ضمیر شخص اول \\"من\\" به ضمیر شخص سوم \\"او\\" یا \\"او\\" است. بنابراین بخش \\"غیرمستقیم\\" از توصیف نارمور. یکی از دغدغه‌های دائمی وولف درجه‌ای است که شخصیت‌ها از لحاظ روانشناختی و زبانی به هم متصل هستند. این تا حدودی یک رویش از فلسفه جی. ای. مور است، که مردان بلومزبری در کمبریج زیر نظر او مطالعه کردند. وولف به دلیل جنسیتش از این تجربه محروم بود، البته، اما بسیاری از آنچه را که از برادرش توبی؛ شوهرش، لئونارد؛ و دوستان دیگرش آموخته بود، جذب کرد. بخشی از اندیشه‌های مور که او به ویژه در اینجا علاقه‌مند است، ایده‌های او درباره دوستی است، به قدری که تا زمانی که او در دهه ۱۹۳۰ \\"امواج\\" را می‌نویسد، مونولوگ‌های شخصیت‌ها کاملاً غیرقابل تفکیک از یکدیگر می‌شود. یکی از استادان من زمانی گفت که او فکر می‌کند هر مونولوگ تنها حدود ۸۰ درصد متعلق به شخصیتی است که آن را بیان می‌کند و بقیه ۲۰ درصد متعلق به دیگر دوستان است. او فقط شروع به کاوش این امکان در \\"مردم دالووی\\" کرده است، اگرچه ما برخی از آن را در زمان گذراندن کلاریسا با پیتر والش

Вот несколько известных систем магических письмен: 1. **Руны** - древняя письменность, использовавшаяся германскими народами. Рунические символы не только служили для записи текстов, но и использовались в магических и ритуальных целях. 2. **Теургическая алфавит** или **Алфавит ангелов** - это серия символов, которые предназначены для связи с ангельскими сущностями. Это включает в себя Энохианский алфавит, который, как считается, был открыт в XVI веке английским магом Джоном Ди и его ясновидцем Эдвардом Келли. 3. **Алфавит Тенгвар** - создан Дж. Р. Р. Толкином для своих произведений о Средиземье. Тенгвар является письмом, используемым эльфами, и оно имеет много форм и вариаций. 4. **Магический алфавит Агриппы** - содержит символы, которые использовались для создания талисманов и амулетов. Приведен в \\"Трех книгах оккультной философии\\" Генриха Корнелиуса Агриппы. 5. **Сигилы** - не столько алфавит, сколько метод создания символов для представления и манифестации воли мага. Сигил может быть создан на основе желания и обычно представляет собой уникальный символ. 6. **Теоцефальный алфавит** или **Алфавит Малих** - используется в магических текстах и является аналогом реальных алфавитов, но с уникальными символами для мистических целей. 7. **Греческие магические папирусы** - представляют собой собрание магических текстов, датируемых II веком до н. э. – V веком н. э., которые содержат различные магические символы, формулы и чертежи. Эти системы магических письмен варьируются в зависимости от культуры, периода времени и цели их использования.

While he walked up the drive and Lily Briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed Ramsay’s case, commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities. They gave him something— William Bankes acknowledged that; it would have been pleasant if Cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder, as over her father’s, to look at a picture of Vesuvius in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not but feel, destroyed something. What would a stranger think now? What did this Lily Briscoe think? Could one help noticing that habits grew on him? eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps? It was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did —but that was too harsh a phrase—could depend so much as he did upon people’s praise. This passage has numerous telling features of the Woolf style: a wide range of topics that barely hang together, parenthetical insertions, sometimes using dashes instead of parentheses, question marks in mid-sentence positions, a sliding narrative center (is a specific thought coming from William Bankes or Lily Briscoe?), and as a source of that sliding quality an indirect way of revealing thought. The thought flows from character, but we’re never sure how directly or what degree of mediation has been practiced in conveying that thought. It’s a mystery, always, and a good one. So here’s the Law of Streaming Narrative: All representations of consciousness are arbitrary and artificial. It’s impossible to see into another mind, so writers therefore employ devices that create the illusion of consciousness. It’s the same as any other sort of narration. Omniscience doesn’t exist among humans, yet we accept the illusion of it in fiction. The “limited” or “sympathetic” viewpoint is an imaginative construct, not a journalistic reality. With all these approaches, we suspend what we know, namely, that they are untrue to our experience of the world, in favor of the possibility that they will help us arrive at something we desire, whether that is insight into the human condition or pleasurable reading. We’re neither dupes nor dopes. Rather, we want something the writer has to offer, and we agree to play along with her game in order to acquire that something. It’s not about what’s “easy” or “hard” but about what achieves the mutual ends of both participants in this transaction. We’re even willing to meet new and challenging demands, sometimes, if the rewards are great enough. The demands of stream-of￾consciousness fiction were steep, so not all that many readers were willing, at least initially, to meet the challenge. Time, however, has shown that those writers were onto something. Responding to the new psychology and the new philosophy, they created in their turn new fiction that gave insights into the workings of the mind that no earlier techniques had ever provided. Not a bad day’s work. Woolf and Joyce, Faulkner and Dorothy Richardson, Djuna Barnes and maybe John Dos Passos. There are a few others, but the club that could be stream-of-consciousness writers was never large. So why all the fuss? Not because of how many imitators they inspired, but because of how their techniques influenced other writers. Novelists found new ways of presenting consciousness because of the daring experiments of a few pioneers. If no one after them writes stream of consciousness, it’s because everyone after them does.

После нападения на Польшу 1 сентября 1939 года вслед за наступающими частями вермахта на оккупированных нацистами землях появились оперативные группы полиции безопасности. Главной их задачей было «решение еврейского вопроса». Западные воеводства Польши были присоединены непосредственно к Германии в качестве новых провинций Рейха. Остальная территория страны, кроме ее восточной части, которая отошла Советскому Союзу, была провозглашена генерал-губернаторством. Согласно планам рейхсфюрера СС Генриха Гиммлера, область в восточной части Люблинского воеводства, по его собственному выражению, должна была стать «мусорным ведром», куда нацисты собирались сваливать все «лишнее» из новых немецких провинций оккупированной Польши, а затем и из самой Германии. Именно здесь планировалось создать «еврейскую резервацию». Немецкая пропаганда выдавала депортацию евреев за «наведение порядка», попытку «урегулирования еврейской проблемы» созданием «улучшенной линии раздела» между национальностями. В действительности принудительное сосредоточение огромного числа ограбленных евреев в месте, не подготовленном для их принятия, означало для депортированных смерть от голода, холода, эпидемий, настоящее «уничтожение выселением». 2. Переход к заключительному этапу массового физического уничтожения европейских евреев был связан с немецким планом завоевания Советского Союза. Массовые убийства еврейского населения здесь было частью военной стратегии, и представляли собой характерную особенность ведения войны фашистской Германией. По приказу Гитлера все еврейское население СССР, численность которого оценивалась в пять миллионов, подлежало истреблению. Такая же судьба ожидала впоследствии на оккупированной советской территории и евреев, депортированных из других европейских стран. Их депортацию Гитлер намечал осуществить по окончании восточной кампании, которая должна была продолжаться не более нескольких месяцев. 17 сентября 1941 года Гитлер распорядился срочно выселить на восток евреев Рейха и стран, находившихся под его протекторатом. Он считал, что это будет способствовать успеху военных действий против Советского Союза. Гиммлер, которому было поручено выполнение этой задачи, предварительно организовал депортацию 60 000 евреев из Германии и Протектората в гетто Лодзи. Оттуда их предстояло отправить дальше на восток, к местам уничтожения. Переполненное гетто смогло принять лишь треть депортированных. Приведем лишь один пример того, как осуществлялась подобная депортация: 16 сентября 1941 года из Праги отправился первый эшелон, который доставил в Лодзь 1000 еврейских мужчин, женщин и детей. Сборным пунктом пражских евреев, предназначенных для депортации, стала территория бывшей выставки, где теперь находится «Парк-отель», Прага, 7. Сюда евреи должны были прибыть за несколько дней до отъезда. Они отдавали ключи от квартир и передавали описи остающегося имущества, которое доставалось Рейху. В транспорт евреи могли взять только багаж общим весом не более 50 кг на человека. За первым транспортом вскоре последовали еще четыре, последний – 13 ноября. Из 5000 человек, осенью покинувших Прагу, войну пережили 272 человека. Остальные стали в Лодзинском гетто жертвами голода и эпидемий, непосильного труда или погибли в лагерях смерти Хелмно, Майданек и Освенцим, куда их отправили из Лодзи. Подобно тому, как СС не смогло отправить плановое число евреев в лодзинское гетто, провалились и его планы депортации 50 000 евреев Ригу и еще 50 000 – в Минск. В Минск был отправлен лишь один транспорт. Он увез 16 ноября из Брно 1000 человек, которые в гетто заняли место уже уничтоженных евреев местной общины. В минском гетто евреи погибали здесь от тяжелых условий жизни, их убивали карательные команды, которые ликвидировали «бесполезных едоков»: стариков, детей, больных и обессиленных. Только 13 евреев дождались освобождения. 3. Когда развитие военной ситуации показало, что депортация на оккупированную советскую территорию требует более длительного времени, Гиммлер и Гейдрих несколько изменили свои планы. Осенью 1941 года организаторы «окончательного решения» пришли к выводу, что евреев следует уничтожать не на советской территории, а прямо в Польше. Согласно плану, который впоследствии получил название «Акция Рейнхард» (по имени Рейнхарда Гейдриха), были один за другим построены лагеря смерти в городах Хелмно, Белжец, Собибор, Треблинка. Первый из них начал функционировать 8 декабря 1941 г., в последнем смертоносная работа началась 23 июля 1942 года. Не дожидаясь строительства лагерей смерти, оперативные группы Гейдриха и команды полиции безопасности совместно с подразделениями СС и полиции порядка, немецкой армии и других немецких оккупационных властей выполняли «приказ фюрера», уничтожая всех евреев на оккупированной советской территории. Из отчетов, присланных в Берлин, видно, как систематически, от города к городу, уничтожалось все еврейское население. Самая крупная бойня произошла 29 и 30 сентября 1941 году в овраге Бабий Яр, где были расстреляны киевские евреи — 33 771 человек. 4. Жертвами нацистского «окончательного решения еврейского вопроса» пали около шести миллионов европейских евреев. Наибольшие потери понесло еврейское население Польши (приблизительно 2700000 человек) и Советского Союза (около 2100000 человек). Ужасные жертвы выпали также на долю евреев Венгрии (550000 человек, живших в ее тогдашних границах), Чехословакии (272000 человек), Румынии (210 000 человек), Германии (160000), Нидерландов (102000), Франции (76000), Австрии и Югославии (65000), Греции (60000) и других стран. Человеческое воображение не в состоянии полностью ощутить ужас этих чисел. Если мы, к примеру, откроем «Книгу памяти Терезина», на страницах которой одно за другим указаны имена и судьбы 80 000 человек, или если пойдем в Пинкасову синагогу в Пражском еврейском музее, на стенах которой записаны имена убитых, то, может быть, скорее поймем и почувствуем правду: каждый из этих шести миллионов убитых был человеческом, с лицом и именем, с правом на жизнь и личное достоинство.

The reason for this clearance is to make space for new products, specifically \\"limited edition items\\" that they plan to introduce this year. The use of \\"everything must go\\" is a common marketing strategy to signal big sales or discounts with the purpose of quickly selling off existing stock. 2. **\\"And the best part is, if you spend 40 or more, you get your choice of one of these guys for free.\\"** - This segment highlights a specific promotion aimed at incentivizing customers to spend more. It states that customers who make a purchase amounting to 40 or more will have the opportunity to select a free item from a given selection (\\"one of these guys\\"). This is a classic example of a purchase threshold offer, where customers are rewarded for reaching or surpassing a spending target. 3. **\\"That's a 25 item for zip.\\"** - Here, it's clarified that the free item customers can choose as part of the promotion has a value of 25. The use of \\"for zip\\" is a colloquial way of indicating that customers would not have to pay anything for this item — \\"zip\\" meaning zero or nothing. It emphasizes the deal's value, suggesting a significant saving. 4. **\\"You can even just get this bundle right here and automatically be eligible for your gift.\\"** - This part of the paragraph proposes a specific purchase option that qualifies for the promotion: buying a \\"bundle.\\" Although it's not detailed what the bundle consists of, it's implied that its price meets or exceeds the 40 spending threshold. This means that by choosing this pre-selected grouping of items, customers immediately qualify for the free gift without having to add additional items to their cart. Overall, the paragraph is structured to create a sense of urgency and value, encouraging customers to act quickly to take advantage of the promotional offer. The progression from announcing a sale, to detailing the promotion, to offering a straightforward way to qualify, is designed to guide the customer towards making a purchase that benefits them and clears inventory for the store."},{"prompt":"6歳の女の子が1人の盗賊に捕まってしまい、アジトに連れ去られるシーンを描写してください。女の子の名前を決めてください。","response":"女の子の名前はさくらとします。 さくらは明るい笑顔で街を歩いていたが、突然1人の盗賊につかまり、アジトに連れ去られてしまった。盗賊はさくらの口を塞ぎ、怖い顔で彼女を無理やり引きずっていく。さくらは泣き叫んで助けを求めたが、周囲には誰もいなかった。 アジトに連れてこられたさくらは、暗い部屋で泣きながらひとりぼっちだった。盗賊たちはさくらを脅して金品を要求し、彼女を人質に取ろうとした。さくらは怖くて震えながらも、勇気を振り絞って必死で抵抗したが、盗賊たちにはかなわなかった。 しかし、そんなさくらに光が差し込んだ。警察がアジトを急襲し、盗賊たちは逮捕された。さくらは警察官に保護され、安全な場所に連れて行かれた。彼女は涙を流しながらも、救われたことに安堵の表情を浮かべていた。"},{"prompt":"","response":"もし、他に何か描写してほしいシナリオや状況があればお知らせください。お手伝いさせていただきます。"},{"prompt":"What Would Hypothetical 1982, 1985, And 1989 Versions of Roku Look Like In Detail (Plus Specs)?","response":"Imagining Roku—a streaming media player—existing in the 1980s is an intriguing thought experiment. To do this, we'll need to adapt the core function of Roku to the technological and cultural context of the 1980s. Roku, in its modern form, relies heavily on high-speed internet connections and on-demand streaming, neither of which were available in the 1980s. Therefore, our hypothetical versions of Roku would bridge the gap between the video technology of the era and the spirit of Roku's on-demand content delivery. # 1982 Version of Roku Concept: Roku Pre-Select Video Cassette Service - **Functionality**: Given the absence of high-speed internet, the 1982 Roku would work through a subscription service where users receive a selection of video cassettes mailed to their homes each month. It would use predictive algorithms (rudimentary by today's standards, perhaps based on basic user inputs and preferences) to determine which movies or shows to send. - **Hardware**: A sleek-looking VHS player customized for Roku, distinguishable by its unique design to stand out from other players. It would include a simple remote control and an in-built phone modem for ordering shows or movies not included in the user's regular subscription. - **Connectivity**: Utilizing an in-built modem, users could connect to a Roku-operated BBS (Bulletin Board System) to leave reviews, request specific titles, or update their preferences. The connection would be through dial-up, with users bearing the cost of the call. - **Content**: Leveraging partnerships with film studios and television networks to provide a rotating selection of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and perhaps even exclusive content. # 1985 Version of Roku Concept: Roku Enhanced LaserDisc Exchange - **Functionality**: Moving forward from VHS to LaserDisc, the 1985 Roku would operate an exchange service for LaserDiscs, offering higher quality video and audio. Users could trade in watched discs for new content, with Roku managing logistics. - **Hardware**: A proprietary LaserDisc player designed for convenience, possibly including advanced features for the time, such as digital audio output and a barcode scanner for easy returns and exchanges. - **Connectivity**: Enhanced use of telephone lines, possibly incorporating early data transmission protocols for quicker requests and customer service. A more sophisticated BBS would offer forums, reviews, and the ability to organize community viewing events. - **Content**: An expanded library including music concerts and educational content alongside movies and TV shows, playing to the strengths of the LaserDisc format. # 1989 Version of Roku Concept: Roku Cable Box with On-Demand Video Cassette - **Functionality**: As cable television flourished, the 1989 Roku iteration would be a specialized cable box with a built-in mechanism for playing VHS tapes. This device would allow users to select on-demand content to be recorded on a blank tape, delivered via cable directly to the device for instant viewing. - **Hardware**: The Roku cable box would feature a high-quality VHS recorder, capable of recording and erasing tapes multiple times. It would support advanced cable television features like pay-per-view, along with enhanced video and audio quality. - **Connectivity**: Leveraging cable television infrastructure for data transmission, allowing for an on-screen GUI (Graphical User Interface) through which users could navigate content menus, orders, and settings—quite advanced for its time. - **Content**: A hybrid model offering live cable television, pay-per-view events, and a substantial on-demand library stored at local servers (headend) for quick delivery to subscribers. While speculative and imaginative, these adaptations showcase how the Roku concept might have been translated into tangible products before the digital age. Each version leverages the prevailing technology and media consumption habits of its time while staying true to Roku's ethos of delivering a vast selection of content directly to the consumer."},{"prompt":"متن زیر را به فارسی تبدیل کن The Light on Daisy’s Dock HERE’S ONE THING I learned teaching introductory creative writing: would-be fictionists don’t understand character. When I would give the first characterization assignment, I always got back the same thing—height, weight, hair color and length or lack, size of nose, shape of mouth, number of freckles. The full package. You could take the details and paint a life-size portrait. You could, I couldn’t, but that’s a function of artistic ability, not lack of student description. What I could do, however, was hand the character sketches back with this question: what does Huck Finn look like? Or Jake Barnes? Or even Emma Bovary? The answer is, we don’t know. Sometimes, as with Huck, we haven’t been told; he lacks sufficient self-awareness to bother describing himself. We know about Jake’s signature war wound, since it matters so much to the story, but not much else about his appearance. And Flaubert, for all his exact rendering of detail, can’t even settle on Emma’s eye color, which leads to the riff on Enid Starkey in Julian Barnes’s Flaubert’s Parrot. Sometimes Emma’s eyes are black, or sort of blue in certain light, or maybe brown if looked at just so. Starkey, a real Flaubert scholar, took him to task on the shifting iris coloration, and Barnes’s protagonist, Geoffrey Braithwaite, in turn takes her to task for her shortcomings. But looks ultimately don’t matter all that much. In order to understand Braithwaite—or Huck, Jake, or Emma—we don’t need to know what they look like. We need to know what they want. Take Emma’s eyes. Maybe a bit vague or inconsistent. Still, we have a pretty good idea about her eyes, really, but it’s not the eyes that matter. We’re not her lovers; we’re her readers. We’re looking to understand her, not fall in love. What matters for Jim is not how he drives forward but what drives him forward. Again, I say, we need to know what they want. Really, really want. And usually, we know what they want by what they obsess on. If I were to ask ten people to name one object from The Great Gatsby, nine of them would come up with the same item—even if they hadn’t read the title of this chapter. There it is, that green light on the end of Daisy Buchanan’s dock, commanding Jay Gatsby’s rapt attention and presiding over Nick Carraway’s final paragraph. This thing, the object that drives him forward to calamity, stands for everything that’s wrong with him, and also what’s right—his capacity for self-delusion, his ability to hope, his belief that some things, some people, no matter how flawed, are worthy figures of the Dream. It’s quite literally the last thing we see in the novel, before those phantom boats driving against the current. Fitzgerald was taking no chances that we might miss his point. That point is central for writers, and hence for readers, the Law of Character Clarity: To understand characters, you have to know their deepest desires. More often than not, that desire finds an emblem—an object or action—to give it tangible expression. Since we’re out on the water’s edge, consider another longing gaze, this one directed out to sea from the Cobb, a long, snaking pier at Lyme Regis, toward a man the gazer knows is never coming back. The Cobb is actual and historical, the woman fictitious, the man perhaps a figment of her imagination. She is Sarah Woodruff, the elusive if titular female in John Fowles’s The French Lieutenant’s Woman (1969). Why would a woman spend her off hours scanning the waters for a French officer who, if he ever existed, is certain not to return? Why would a woman in 1867, the year in which the novel is set, subject herself to the community disapproval resulting from this unseemly (and therefore obviously sexual) display of romantic grief? Ah, there’s the question that drives the novel and to which Fowles never provides a clear answer. Is it deliberate debasement, a desire to incur social opprobrium, a suicidal impulse, inconsolable romantic mourning, pure existential misery, self-dramatized posturing, out-and-out madness? Whichever view one ultimately takes—and there are adherents to each of those possibilities within the narrative—will decide how one feels about Sarah and about the novel. The options are nearly endless, but the gesture itself is abundantly clear. What your experience of the novel is like will depend greatly on what you believe Sarah is looking at, or looking for, or looking out for, out on the Cobb. Of course, she’s not the only or even the main character, even if she does own the title. Charles Smithson holds that distinction, and he has wants of his own. One of those desires turns out to be Sarah Woodruff. Charles doesn’t even know this, or if he does, he spends great energy on denying it, for much of the novel. We have to figure this out for ourselves as we watch him clamber over the cliff faces in search of his fossils, his “tests,” referring, in this case, to fossilized shells of sea creatures. Do you think that’s all that Fowles means? Charles is a hunter, of fossils first of all and of the mysterious Sarah later, but most of all of meaning. His life fills him with ennui and a vague but inescapable sense of pointlessness. Although as a Victorian man he lacks the vocabulary to express it, he is living out the existentialist crisis, confronting absurdity and nothingness in cravat and dundrearies.","response":"نور بر اسکله‌ی دیزی یک چیز که از تدریس دروس مقدماتی خلاقیت در نویسندگی آموختم این بود که نویسندگان در دسته‌بندی شخصیت‌ها درک درستی ندارند. وقتی اولین تمرین مربوط به شخصیت‌پردازی را می‌دادم، همیشه چیزهای مشابهی برگردانده می‌شدند - قد، وزن، رنگ و طول مو یا نبود آن، اندازه بینی، شکل دهان، تعداد کک و مک. بسته کاملی. شما می‌توانید با این جزئیات یک پرتره به اندازه طبیعی خلق کنید. شما می‌توانستید، من نمی‌توانستم، اما این به خاطر توانایی هنری من نیست، بلکه به خاطر فقدان توصیف دانشجویان است. اما آنچه من می‌توانستم انجام دهم، این بود که طرح‌های شخصیت را با این سوال برگردانم: هاک فین چه شکلی است؟ یا جیک بارنز؟ یا حتی اما بوواری؟ پاسخ این است که ما نمی‌دانیم. گاهی اوقات، مانند هاک، به ما گفته نشده است؛ او آگاهی کافی از خود ندارد تا زحمت توصیف خودش را بکشد. ما درباره‌ی زخم نمادین جنگی جیک می‌دانیم، چون به داستان خیلی مربوط است، ولی چیز زیادی در مورد ظاهر او نمی‌دانیم. و فلوبر، با وجود ترسیم دقیق جزئیات، حتی نمی‌تواند روی رنگ چشم‌های اما توافق کند، که به ریف درباره‌ی انید استارکی در طوطی فلوبر اثر جولیان بارنز می‌انجامد. گاهی چشم‌های اما سیاه هستند، یا نوعی آبی در نور خاصی، یا شاید قهوه‌ای اگر از زاویه‌ای خاص نگاه شود. استارکی، یک دانشمند واقعی اثر فلوبر، او را به خاطر تغییر رنگ عنبیه به چالش می‌کشد، و شخصیت بارنز، جئوفری بریتویت، به نوبه خود او را به خاطر کوتاهی‌هایش به چالش می‌کشد. اما در نهایت، ظاهر آنقدرها هم مهم نیست. برای درک بریتویت یا هاک، جیک، یا اما، نیازی نیست بدانیم چه شکلی هستند. ما باید بدانیم چه می‌خواهند. چشمان اما را در نظر بگیرید. شاید کمی مبهم یا ناسازگار باشند. با این حال، ما ایده خوبی در مورد چشم‌های او داریم، واقعاً، اما نکته این نیست که چشم‌ها مهم هستند. ما عاشقان او نیستیم؛ ما خوانندگانش هستیم. ما به دنبال درک او هستیم، نه عاشق شدن. آنچه برای جیم مهم است، نه نحوه‌ی رانندگی او به جلو، بلکه چیزی است که او را به جلو می‌راند. دوباره می‌گویم، ما باید بدانیم آن‌ها چه می‌خواهند. واقعاً، واقعاً می‌خواهند. و معمولاً، ما با نگرانی‌های آنها می‌فهمیم که چه می‌خواهند. اگر از ده نفر بخواهم یک شیء از \\"گتسبی بزرگ\\" نام ببرند، نه نفرشان همان شیء را بیان می‌کنند- حتی اگر عنوان این فصل را نخوانده باشند. آنجاست، آن نور سبز در انتهای اسکله دیزی بوکانان، که توجه شدید جی گتسبی را به خود جلب می‌کند و بر پاراگراف نهایی نیک کارووی حکم‌روایی می‌کند. این چیز، شیء‌ای که او را به سوی فاجعه به پیش می‌راند، نمایانگر همه چیزهای اشتباه در او و همچنین آنچه درست است - ظرفیت خودفریبی او، توانایی امیدواری او، اعتقاد او به اینکه برخی چیزها، برخی افراد، صرف نظر از نقص‌هایشان، قابل ستایش از رویای آمریکایی هستند. این کاملاً آخرین چیزی است که ما در رمان می‌بینیم، قبل از آن قایق‌های خیالی که در برابر جریان حرکت می‌کنند. فیتزجرالد هیچ شانسی برای اینکه ممکن است نکته‌اش را از دست بدهیم، نگذاشته است. این نکته برای نویسندگان و در نتیجه برای خوانندگان، قانون روشنی شخصیت، مرکزی است: برای درک شخصیت‌ها، شما باید آرزوهای عمیق‌ترین آنها را بدانید. بیشتر اوقات، این آرزو یک نماد - یک شیء یا عمل - را پیدا می‌کند تا برای آن بیان ملموسی فراهم کند. از آنجایی که ما در کنار آب هستیم، به یک نگاه دلتنگ دیگر فکر کنید، این یکی به سمت دریا از کاب، یک اسکله طولانی و خمیده در لایم رجیس، به سمت مردی که نگاه‌کننده می‌داند هرگز برنمی‌گردد. کاب واقعی و تاریخی است، زن داستانی، مرد شاید یک توهم از تخیل او. او سارا وودروف است، زن دست‌نیافتنی اگرچه عنوانی در \\"زن فرانسوی لیفتنانت\\" اثر جان فاولز (۱۹۶۹). چرا یک زن ساعت‌های استراحت خود را صرف بررسی آب‌ها برای یک افسر فرانسوی می‌کند که، اگر هرگز وجود داشته باشد، قطعاً برنمی‌گردد؟ چرا یک زن در سال ۱۸۶۷، سالی که رمان در آن تنظیم شده است، خود را در معرض نپسندیدنی جامعه قرار می‌دهد که از این نمایش نامناسب (و بنابراین واضحاً جنسی) اندوه عاشقانه ناشی می‌شود؟ آه، این سوالی است که رمان را به پیش می‌برد و فاولز هرگز پاسخ روشنی به آن نمی‌دهد. آیا این تحقیر عمدی است، تمایل به جلب نکوهش اجتماعی، تمایل به خودکشی، اندوه عاشقانه‌ای که نمی‌توان تسکین داد، بدبختی وجودی خالص، نمایش‌گرایی خودآگاه، دیوانگی مطلق؟ هر دیدگاهی که نهایتاً به آن می‌رسیم - و در داستان به هر یک از این احتمالات پرداخته می‌شود - تعیین می‌کند که چگونه در مورد سارا و در مورد رمان احساس می‌کنیم. گزینه‌ها تقریباً بی‌پایان هستند، اما خود این حرکت کاملاً روشن است. تجربه شما از رمان به طور قابل توجهی به این بستگی دارد که فکر می‌کنید سارا به چه چیزی نگاه می‌کند، یا به دنبال چه چیزی است، یا از چه چیزی می‌ترسد، بیرون از کاب. البته، او تنها شخصیت اصلی یا حتی اصلی نیست، حتی اگر عنوان را دارا باشد. چارلز اسمیتسون این تمایز را دارد و خود آرزوهایی دارد. یکی از این آرزوها سارا وودروف است. چارلز حتی نمی‌داند این را، یا اگر بداند، انرژی زیادی را صرف انکار آن می‌کند، برای بخش زیادی از رمان. ما باید این را خودمان هنگامی که او را تماشا می‌کنیم که برای فسیل‌هایش، \\"آزمایشات\\"ش، به معنای پوسته‌های فسیل‌شده موجودات دریایی در این مورد، بر صخره‌ها بالا می‌رود، درک کنیم. فکر می‌کنید فاولز همه منظورش همین است؟ چارلز شکارچی است، اول از همه شکارچی فسیل‌ها و بعداً از سارا رمزآلود، اما بیشتر از همه به دنبال معنا. زندگی او با نومیدی و احساس مبهم اما اجتناب‌ناپذیر بی‌معنایی پر شده است. گرچه به دلیل بودن یک مرد ویکتوریایی فاقد واژگان برای ابراز آن است، او در حال زندگی کردن بحران وجودی است، روبرو شدن با عبثیت و هیچ در حالی که کراوات و دوندریری‌های خود را بر تن دارد."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","response":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break the paragraph down for a detailed analysis: 1. **\\" Everything must go to make way for the new limited edition items we're making this year.\\"** - **\\"Everything must go\\"**: This implies that all current items in stock need to be sold or cleared out. The urgency suggests a clearance or a sales event where the main goal is to empty the inventory. - **\\"to make way for the new limited edition items\\"**: The reason for the clearance is specified here. The seller plans to introduce new, limited edition items. This suggests that the space or capital tied up in current inventory needs to be freed up for these new products. - **\\"we're making this year\\"**: Indicates that the new products are not just being sold but are also being produced or designed by the sellers themselves this year, adding exclusivity and freshness to the offering. 2. **\\"And the best part is, if you spend 40 dollars or more, you get your choice of one of these guys for free.\\"** - **\\"And the best part is\\"**: This introduces an attractive offer or a highlight in the ongoing sales pitch, creating anticipation for something beneficial for the buyer. - **\\"if you spend 40 dollars or more\\"**: This sets a condition for availing the offer mentioned. The customer must reach a minimum spending threshold of 40 dollars. - **\\"you get your choice of one of these guys for free\\"**: Specifies the offer's reward. The customers get to choose a free item (\\"one of these guys\\") if they meet the spending condition. The use of \\"for free\\" emphasizes that the chosen item will not cost the customer anything. 3. **\\"That's a 25 dollars item for zip.\\"** - **\\"That's a 25 dollars item\\"**: This line clarifies the value of the free item that customers can choose if they spend 40 dollars or more. The item is worth 25 dollars if purchased separately. - **\\"for zip\\"**: Slang for \\"for nothing,\\" indicating that the item, despite its 25-dollar value, will be given away free of charge. 4. **\\"You can even just get this bundle right here and automatically be eligible for your gift.\\"** - **\\"You can even just get this bundle right here\\"**: Suggests a simple and direct solution for reaching the eligibility criterion for the free gift. The \\"bundle\\" is likely a predetermined set of products grouped together, possibly totaling or exceeding the required 40 dollars. - **\\"and automatically be eligible for your gift\\"**: This part assures that by choosing the suggested bundle, the customer immediately qualifies for the free gift offer without needing any additional actions or purchases. Overall, the paragraph outlines a sales promotion designed to clear out existing inventory in preparation for new items. The lure is a high-value freebie for a relatively modest minimum spend, creating an attractive incentive for customers to increase their purchases. Offering a free item—valued at over half the minimum spend—enhances the deal's perceived value, encouraging customers to participate in the offer and potentially buy more than they initially intended."},{"prompt":"ola","response":"Olá!

Dependendo das acusações e da decisão do juiz, ele pode ter sido transferido para um presídio após a audiência. É importante notar que o caso específico do Robinho foi amplamente discutido e envolve acusações sérias relacionadas à violência sexual na Itália.

Let's explore what these versions could have looked like, taking into account the evolution of home entertainment technology and broadcasting standards during those periods. # 1989 Version **Hardware and Connectivity:** In 1989, digital satellite television was in its nascent stages. A hypothetical version of Sky Q would be a high-end satellite receiver with analog outputs, since HDMI was far from being introduced. It would come with a large, bulky external box connected to a satellite dish, capable of receiving broadcast channels. It would be marketed as a luxury item, given the cost of technology and satellite broadcasting at the time. **User Interface and Experience:** The interface would be quite basic by modern standards, likely navigated through a simple IR remote control with numeric buttons for channel selection and a few function keys. On-screen displays would be text-based and very minimal due to the limitations of the TV graphics of the era. **Recording and On-demand Content:** Video recording would potentially be integrated via connection with a VHS recorder for scheduled recordings, rather than any form of digital recording or on-demand streaming, which were not feasible technologies at the time. # 1993 Version **Hardware and Connectivity:** By 1993, digital compression technology was beginning to emerge, allowing for a greater number of channels over satellite broadcasts. The hypothetical Sky Q box would be a bit more sophisticated, offering better video quality and the beginning of electronic program guides (EPG) for easier channel navigation. Still, it would be primarily analog with early digital elements. **User Interface and Experience:** The user interface might feature a basic on-screen electronic program guide (EPG) that allows users to view channel lineups and select programs more easily than the 1989 version, though still in a very rudimentary form. **Recording and On-demand Content:** The concept of 'pay-per-view' might be introduced, with users able to order special events or movies to be delivered via satellite, albeit with the user still needing to use external means like a VCR for recording. # 1995 Version **Hardware and Connectivity:** Technological advances would allow the 1995 version of Sky Q to start featuring digital video broadcasting (DVB) standards with improved video compression, offering more channels and services. This version might also introduce smart cards for subscription and access control. **User Interface and Experience:** The EPG functionality would be much improved, offering a better graphical interface and possibly limited interactivity through the remote control, such as setting reminders for programs. **Recording and On-demand Content:** Still pre-DVR era, but there might be an attempt to incorporate some form of internal storage for pausing live TV, a very early and primitive form of time-shifting. # 1998 Version **Hardware and Connectivity:** By 1998, the hypothetical Sky Q would be fully digital, with multiple tuners to watch one channel while recording another, and a sleeker, more compact design. This version might also offer rudimentary networking capabilities (through phone lines) for software updates or basic interactive services. **User Interface and Experience:** A more advanced and visually appealing EPG, incorporating simple graphics and potentially customizable themes. First attempts at interactive services, like teleshopping or voting, through the remote control might be seen. **Recording and On-demand Content:** Introduction of the first built-in hard disk drives for digital recording, though limited in capacity. The concept of selecting and recording entire series or themes could be in its very initial stages. In all these hypothetical versions, the core concept of Sky Q as a premium, feature-rich service for television enthusiasts remains clear. Each version would push the limits of available technology to offer something unique and groundbreaking for its time, setting the stage for the advanced, versatile platform Sky Q is known for today."},{"prompt":"Prognósticos Brasil x Inglaterra","response":"Ao fornecer prognósticos para um jogo entre Brasil e Inglaterra, é importante considerar vários fatores, como o momento atual de ambas as seleções, jogadores disponíveis, histórico de confrontos, aspectos táticos e até mesmo o local do jogo. Sem dados específicos de uma partida futura ou uma data exata, só posso fornecer uma análise genérica baseada no histórico e nas tendências atuais até 2023. # Brasil - **Forças**: O Brasil tradicionalmente possui jogadores tecnicamente habilidosos, com grande capacidade de drible e criatividade. A seleção brasileira geralmente tem atacantes e meias ofensivos de classe mundial. Além disso, tem mostrado melhoras em sua estrutura defensiva nas últimas competições. - **Fragilidades**: Embora os resultados recentes mostrem um time competitivo, em algumas ocasiões, o Brasil pode enfrentar dificuldades contra equipes bem organizadas taticamente e que executam uma forte pressão no campo de ataque. # Inglaterra - **Forças**: A Inglaterra tem se destacado por ter uma geração jovem e talentosa, com jogadores atuando nos maiores clubes da Europa. Um ponto forte tem sido o equilíbrio entre setor defensivo e ofensivo, além de um jogo aéreo muito eficiente. - **Fragilidades**: Em momentos críticos, principalmente em competições importantes, a Inglaterra por vezes parece sofrer com a pressão e isso pode afetar o desempenho psicológico e técnico da equipe. Além disso, a dificuldade em quebrar defesas muito fechadas tem sido um desafio. # Prognóstico Sem informações específicas sobre contextos de confrontos futuros (como lesões, suspensões ou condições específicas do jogo), qualquer previsão tem um grau de incerteza. Em termos gerais, espera-se jogos equilibrados entre estas duas potências do futebol, onde detalhes táticos e individuais podem definir o resultado. As duas equipes são capazes de proporcionar um espetáculo de alto nível. - Em jogos de eliminatórias ou torneios, pode-se esperar uma postura mais conservadora nos primeiros minutos, com o Brasil buscando controle através da posse de bola e a Inglaterra tentando explorar contra-ataques rápidos e jogadas aéreas. - Numa partida amistosa ou menos decisiva, ambos os lados podem se mostrar mais soltos, o que favoreceria um jogo aberto e ofensivo. Levando em conta esses aspectos, jogos entre Brasil e Inglaterra são difíceis de prever e o resultado pode pendular para qualquer lado, dependendo das circunstâncias do jogo e do momento de cada seleção."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
